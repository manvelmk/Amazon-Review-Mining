A3MW7JNPGIKP5C,0000031887,Marie,0,0,"I got this in pink and white for a slender 2 year old. It is a little on the loose side, but it does stay on. While my little girl is a bit of a tomboy, as she is overshadowed by 5 older brothers, she does enjoy wearing this over her jeggings and running around and playing. Her playdates, two who are closer to 3, are madly in love with the tutus--it's a good thing we only have one of them at a time. I think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch, but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has. The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure. I have made my own tutus, but they never looked as nice or were so soft.",5,Great fit and quality,1400630400,"05 21, 2014"

While I still love Giada's cooking, this set is just a way for Food Network to make money. They really cheated with these DVD's. All they have are the video from the show, no text recipes, no link to the on line shows and no computer support. They play in Windows media player but the set does not contain the recipes. You can get more by taping the shows and then going to the web to download recipes. Another disappointment is the so so transfer quality to DVD. Perhaps I've been spoiled by HD and Tivo but the older shows I've recorded have had better playback quality than the episodes on the DVD's. It is in the old 480p but the quality of the transfer to DVD is dark and about the same quality as your average old VHS tape, not DVD quality. I get the impression Food Network got cheap and subbed out the DVD transfer to the lowest bidder (China?) and it shows.I could watch Giada read the dictionary and her cooking is really first rate. But, that's all you get is watching Giada. Thank god she is easy to understand and her recipes are easy to follow. But to get consistent results on some of the dishes, you should search the web and find the hard copies.  While Giada herself is great, this set is a waste of money.

Of course we all know she has a team to do all the prep work and clean up, but we can pretend, can't we? Lots of her earlier episodes with lots of food and friends. Lemon cakes, shrimp dishes, brownies, salads, entrees. I recently made her Szechuan Noodles and the first bowl cost me $40! That's 'cause I didn't have any of the ingredients you need to make it! But once you splurge on all the condiments, you're home free.  I have eaten Szechuan Noodles all week! I can't get enough of her recipe. Hot, cold, warm. They are SO good!

Joe HerzanekAs the single mother of a heroin addict, I believed addiction was a complex and confusing conundrum.  Being a control freak, I struggled to understand even the delicate changes occurring in my son.  I spent hours, days, months researching addiction, recovery and relapse, hoping to find the magic cure.  And then I was handed, ""Why Don't They Just Quit"", the award winning self-help book written by Joe and Judy Herzanek.Joe writes a powerful and honest account of his own struggle with addiction and subsequent successful recovery, thirty years strong.  He provides valuable and often misunderstood insights from the addict's point of view, offering amazingly simple reasons for why the addict does not quit.""Consequences became a reason for using, not a deterrent"" Joe explains as he explores reasons addicts just don't quit.  Drugs dull the senses, numb the pain and fade the situations, allowing the addict an escape from their problems. ""People use drugs to increase pleasure and decrease pain,"" writes  Joe.""Families and friends always try to help the addict see the problem. It doesn't happen over night. They do not see the problem as it unfolds; this person typically is in denial. They will typically put this off rather than confront."" Joe HerzanekDespite mounting pressures, whether financial, social, legal or emotional, the addict cannot see the problem for what it has become; rather the mounting pressures become the reason to continue using, in order to NOT deal with them. It seems so obvious when Joe describes the stress and the inability to deal with it that creates the vicious cycle I helplessly watched my son spiral through.Joe recounts personal failures and near tragic family circumstances as a result of addictions, but also provides a road map of sorts to navigate through the cause and progression of addiction, the treatment options as well as common sense answers to not so simple questions.In ""Why Don't They Just Quit"" Joe aptly dispels the myth of hitting rock bottom:""This whole idea of ""hitting bottom"" is out of date. Some people with wait years-even decades- for their friends to reach thus mythical point in their alcohol and drug use. But why wait for them to ""hit bottom""? Why not help them by raising their bottom? There are ways to encourage someone to reach their bottom much earlier. In doing so. We can avoid a lot of unnecessary pain and heartache- and maybe even save their life. For some people, hitting bottom will be six feet underground"". Joe HerzanekAs I struggled to `tough love' it with my son, I never thought of it as raising his bottom. I only looked at as a way to preserve my sanity, and then only after I attempted to help my son, which really meant enabling the behavior to continue.""So does everyone have to hit rock bottom? I would say no. Tough love can prevent a substance abuser from prolonging their usage. There are loving ways to refuse to rescue someone that in the long run will help them to choose recovery.""Loving means doing the right thing to help."" Joe HerzanekJoe leaves no stone unturned when it comes to addiction and its far-reaching consequences. Addiction affects the entire family, from spouses, to parents, to siblings.Full of useful quotes and quips from both famous and not so famous, as well as personal adages from his family and friends, Joe Herzanek takes a very messy, complex and taboo subject, and twists it into a story of hope, courage and healing ""Quitting is a moment in time. It is not recovery"" Joe warns the reader.  He provides treatment options and despite being a chaplain, he tempers his own faith with the 12-step `higher power"".""The last thing I want to do in this section is to get too preachy. Spiritual growth is very personal. What I am saying is that spirituality is a big part of recovery and is too important to ignore."" Joe HerzanekI highly recommend this read to any person living with or loving an addict. A toolbox of helpful insights, answers to seemingly impossible questions, and road map through the struggles of addiction; this book is the ultimate idiots guide to addiction, recovery and relapse, and a must to all struggling in this realm.",5,Why Don't THEY Just Quit?,1322956800,"12 4, 2011"

The video discussions were meant to be catalysts, we felt, catalysts toward the process of opening a dialogue within our family, and our minds individually.  When one family member falls ill from the disease of addiction, everything is seen through a shattered mirror from everyone.  Joe Herzanek's exceptional book, his wisdom, and plethora of real life experiences were, for us, such a positive resource, along with the dvd roundtable discussions --- active and accurate learning tools and examples of the whats and how tos that parents and siblings need.  His advice put us on the path to really help our son.  Dealing with and recognizing the fact that one has this disease is a slow, and evolving process that calls for intense work, introspection, commitment, and more.  It also requires that a family make a paradigm shift away from accusations to the addict and past unworkable behaviors, toward taking baby steps to forgiveness, a return to love, health and focus on one day at a time.  We found it to be an invaluable reference, and have gone back to visit it many times.  Keeping an open mind is vital to dealing with addiction.

A2T8A34ZSAXGHA,0000589012,SharonLong,2,3,"""Why Don't They Just Quit"" could not hold my attention that I wouldn't even dare to bore my adult substance addiction therapy group with it. To show this to a population of substance abusers would put them to sleep. The kind of addiction films that stimulate my clients are the ones that explain how they got addicted, why they are addicted, and what can be done about it from a psychological, biological, and physiology perspective. Psychological, biological, and physiological films make them feel as if they are a person first with some issues, instead of making them feel they are labeled as a problem with the identity of an alcoholic or addict (a person second) in which this DVD takes that position. Good addiction films today move fast, scene to scene, with music in background and people talking scene to scene with speed. This DVD has the same two or four people sitting around a table talking about ""the alcoholic or drug user"" with the same monotone voices. The background is black and has a bowl of fruit to look at on the table but doesn't even have something to look at in the background such as cars going by in a window or pictures or a bookshelf. This DVD definitely isn't for substance user/abuser audience or a therapist that already has knowledge about addictions. It is more suited for those that don't know anything about addictions and who doesn't have substance-using issues. I would recommend this DVD for family members experiencing a love one with using issues or a student first learning about addictions for their studies in the mental health or medical field because the DVD pretty much covers all the basics A to Z about understanding a person with alcohol or drug issues.

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""",1,2,"'Why Abundant Oil Hasn't Cut Gasoline Prices' tells us that for the first time since 1995, the U.S. will likely produce more oil than it imports; meanwhile, fuel consumption has fallen 16% below its 2007 peak. Most of the new product comes from places like North Dakota, Wyoming, and Oklahoma - far from refining hubs. Limited pipeline capacity forces moving the product on barges and trains, adding up to $17/barrel. The Jones Act further complicates transport within the U.S. Thus, it is often cheaper for Gulf Coast refiners to send gas to Brazil instead of N.Y.C. At the same time, refiners are required to blend 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol into fuel sold domestically - about 400 million gallons more than needed, thereby requiring the purchase of credits (now 66 cents/gallon) that also add costs.'What Good Are Low Prices if the Shelves Are Empty' says Wal-Mart has added 455 stores (13%) in the last five years, while the number of employees in the U.S. is down 1.4%. Wal-Mart has been last in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for department and discount stores for six years running.'Think Colossal' reports Samsung accounts for 17% of South Korea's GDP, while employing 370,000 worldwide. Electronics is the largest Samsung component, others range from insurance, shipbuilding, construction, appliances, and textiles. The first step in moving into new categories is to start small - eg. making a key component for the industry, ideally something costly to manufacture (less competition). This also gives Samsung managers insight into the target industry. Samsung spent $21.5 billion in capital expenditures last year for its electronics division, double that of Apple. The company was founded in 1938 by the father of its current CEO. Sansung produced 400 million cell phones in 2012; assembly takes place in cells (not using assembly lines) and is completed by an individual. In 2011 Samsung announced its intent to spend $20 billion by 2020 to develop proficiencies in medical devices, solar panels, LED lighting, biotech, and electric car batteries.",5,Well Worth Reading -,1365033600,"04 4, 2013"

There is no reason to shroud it in a fable of unusual circumstances involving characters of little to no substance.  It continues to work off the fact that what people in the past considered influential somehow and always seems to weasel its way, as a prominent piece of literature, into a time period like today where it does not belong.  Im sure many people read the prophet, but it does not enrich or enlighten them in the least, and if it does it is for a brief period of time.  All that was read is assumedly forgotten within minutes after it is all comprehended, to some little extent.

I was curious to see what attracted her, so I looked into them too ( I was either eight or nine  at the time). I believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what I was being force-fed by nuns in  catechism class. Rereading Gibran now, I'm struck by the notion that Hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote Siddhartha. They  contain many of the same themes: No one else can guide you on your path.  You must select your own course. Preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen.  True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books.

It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the ""strange little book"" or ""the little black book"" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was ""The Counsels"" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as ""the poet-prophet par-excellence"" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, ""extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern."" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:""Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature. And in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves. Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper.

It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters.

I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god.

Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:""It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description ""divinely inspired.""

And to each question the prophet provides an answer.For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow.But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet.

A2NHD7LUXVGTD3,000100039X,doc peterson,1,1,"_The Prophet_ is a short read (my copy checks in at just under 100 pages), but its berevity belies both the power and beauty of Gibran's words.  At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter ""Love"", Gibran writes, ""... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ...""  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading ""The Prophet"" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my ""human-ness"" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.  Undeniably readers will have a visceral reaction (although, apparently given the reviews of some, not all reactions are positive.)  Highly recommended, if only to cause one to examine their own life.  After all, ""the unexamined life is not worth living.""",5,a beautiful poetic commentary on what it is to be human,1344729600,"08 12, 2012"
A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,000100039X,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",3,4,"The Prophet is about a mysterious religious thinker who is about to leave for his native land.  Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want.",5,Transcend Human Subjectivity to Find Godlike Objectivity,980380800,"01 25, 2001"

Woncisz ""LADIDAH""",4,4,"I plan to buy 3 more copies from Amazon, for my departing son & distant friends.Last night, I made a mad dash to get a copy of this book, ten minutes before the book store closed; because I couldn't find my old one.  I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.  But don't be so easily deceived, because this book packs more useful information than any 50-pound college textbook, without the endless verbage of a 1,000 page Russian novel.It is small, the paper of good weight and quality (the ones I always purchase, at least), the print is big and the illustrations done by Mr. Gibran are simple yet humana and divinical.  The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.  I was first given this book by a friend, as a departing gift for a 7,000 land/sea voyage, back in 1983.I hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me.

But it wasn't till I read ""The Prophet"" by Kahlil Gibran did I find spirituality and the serenity/peace within me, even in the midst of chaos. His writings taught me to slow down and listen in silence to the inner whisperings of my soul where I found ""me"". Each individual passage is a life lesson, so eloquently written, and yet so simple in belief that you gain and accept your ""self"" -- your destiny in this earthly adventure. You'll find that you will pick it up often, no matter what your beliefs or situation/need, for it will give you the answers you seek until you know them so well, it almost will become a way of life -- the inner peace to deal with even the most tragic of circumstances. When my young husband unexpectedly died, the passage on DEATH was such a comfort. In memory of him, I have given each of the brothers, sisters, daughters and granddaughters a copy, to know the way of life by the right path which he led by virtually every passage as a man of incredible character, and greatly honored in both life and death.

AFY0BT42DDYZV,000100039X,Enamorato,5,6,"These days, Kahlil Gibran's ""The Prophet"" often gets dismissed as ""hippie"" literature. Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. ""It Must be a cult,"" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics (""On Love"", ""On Work"", ""On Joy and Sorrow"", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem ""On Children"" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, ""Breaths.""""Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.""At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a ""middle ground"" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in ""unwinding"" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of ""The Prophet"" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's ""Search Inside"" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with.

A2BQZRA2P81BQG,000100039X,"Gene Rhea Tucker ""TuckerResearch""",2,4,"The language is poetic, but it is not poetry.  It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  ""Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'""Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all ""cosmic"" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: ""He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.""Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this ""It Takes a Village"" gem: ""And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.""  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  ""The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.""  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of ""The Prophet"" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:""Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'""Forget that Jesus said, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.""  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole ""one source, many wells"" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  ""Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!""  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of ""love thy neighbor"" philosophy, it still defines ""good"" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a ""do unto others"" prescription, but ""You are good when you are one with yourself.""If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, ""Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.""  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (""a truth"") to God:""Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.""Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  ""You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!""  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (""You are good when you are one with yourself,"" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of ""The Prophet.""  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that ""The Prophet"" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that ""The Prophet"" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word ""hedon.""  ""Hedonist"" sounds like a philosophical school, as does ""epicurean.""  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)",2,"Unfortunately, the twin credos of ""The Prophet"" are any path to God is the right path and if it feels good do it",1388534400,"01 1, 2014"

There are so many books on my reading list and so little time to read them all that getting an unasked-for book feels like someone actually stealing from me: stealing valuable reading time.In the case of *The Prophet,* however, I did not resent the choice of my benefactor, even though I had not asked for it.First of all, it was a very quick read, consisting of twenty-nine poetic speeches by the fictional ""prophet."" He delivers them as his last word on various topics, since he is about to head back home after having lived in a foreign city for twelve years, and the people ask him to speak on all the important issues that touch on human life: family, food, work, emotions, economics, social problems, art, morality, spirituality, death, etc.On most of these issues, the prophet takes what might be called an Eastern stance. He stresses the importance of ""letting go"" rather than ""taking charge,"" whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts.

It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone has sold more than four million copies.  It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece.  The Story is about a prophet leaving a town, and as he leaves he imparts some of his knowledge to the towns people.  Gibran himself was born in Lebanon in 1883.  He was a poet, artist, and philosopher.  His fame and influence has spread through the world, superceding linguistic and cultural barriers.  His poetry has been translated into more than twenty languages, and his drawings and paintings have been distributed and showcased all around the world.  In the last twenty years of his life he lived in the United States, and began to write in English.  The book The Prophet was written during this time period.  His words and pictures change the way that people look at life, and people find them to be an expression of the deepest impulses of man's heart and mind.  The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years.  He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth.  We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years.  The entire book occurs on the date of his departure.  As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things.  He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them.  He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy.  He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love.  He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue.  This book is an interesting book.  It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing.  These are words to live by, and tell others to live by.  This book is certainly a book that everyone should read.  Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and it's many quandaries from a different perspective.  This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It's lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923.  The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then the world as a whole might become a more easily survivable place.",4,A masterpiece of life's wisdom,988934400,"05 4, 2001"

There is no need for artifice or embellishment because the work is simply genuine, elegant, and powerful enough to transport the reader not to another -&gt;place&lt;-, but to another -&gt;state&lt;-.

This may all sound good, but in practice has little to do with what we observe in the world around us (and is completely unworkable both individually and in society!)The traditional Christian view, boring though it may at first seem, is that there is no perfect holiness within us; rather, we holistic unities of imperfection and rebellion. Granted, we consist of both material and immaterial substance, but the material and immaterial are inseperable except by death. Gibran deals with the rational problems arising from his irreconcilable view of the sprit versus the world by, of course, positing reincarnation upon us.Christian theology deals with all the issues addressed by Gibran, but without making us all out to be God. And without relying on the terrible concept of reincarnation (the only thing I can think of that would be worse than enduring a lifetime of suffering would be to endure an endless procession of lifetimes of suffering).

As he departs the townspeople gather to wish him well. A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.

A1UVPSLUQYY2F9,000100039X,Michael E. Burgess,1,1,"This is my all-time favorite work of literature.The first time I read this book I was 15 years old.  A great friend's father (a high school guidance counselor) gave it to me in an attempt to broaden my philosophical, intellectual and literary horizons.  The book had the desired effect.  I opened it that afternoon and did not put it down until I had read every last page in one sitting.  I was transfixed.  I finished reading it in approximately three hours, front to back.  My philosophy, my world view and my life were all changed forever.Tons of people have reviewed the textual content of the book but it is more than that.  This work is arguably the greatest literary accomplishment of Gibran's lifetime and it isn't just textual.  It is also textural.  The Prophet is poetic and it inspires a sense of inner peace and harmony just by reading the words written on its pages; simple messages which resonated like a cannon in a young mind.  As it turns out they still resonate in exactly the same way now that I am older.  I have read The Prophet a total of 22 times during the course of my life and each time I read it I discover some new facet of my existence that I can apply its wisdom to.Over the years I have shared this amazing book with loved ones, friends, coworkers, even a university professor, who to my great surprise, had never read it.  This is a seminal work and should be required reading for any person who considers himself/herself to be 'educated'.Aside from the passages in the Bible, this is the greatest work of literary art in existence.

Then a friend laid it in my hands a few months ago just at a point in my life when I could actually grasp it. I read just one page and Gibran's words were so beautiful, so powerful, so truthful that I had to get a copy of my own.Almustafa, the main character, is a prophet of God; he is Christ, Buddha, Krishna, the Higher Self. He is the familiar soul that walks between heaven and earth in all humans and all creatures. As he is about to leave the city of Orphalese to return ""home,"" the people there sorrowfully beg him to share with them his wisdom. One by one they ask Almustafa to speak of love, of children, of eating and drinking, crime and punishment, of houses and self-knowledge, among other basic topics of life. His answers come in precisely crafted poetry that is deceptively simple, stunningly beautiful and potent in their spiritual depth. Afmustafa's responses to the people of Orphalese represent the distillation of Gibran's own Self-mastery, his own unified consciousness, and spiritual awakening.This short book should be read slowly and repeatedly until all its hidden truths are unveiled, even if it takes rereading it years after the first time.

I started reading it shortly afterward and honestly had to stop for a little while because I tried consuming too much (sorry, my normal is history, historical fiction, and either sci-fi or fantasy); after all, this is poetry and philosophy and should be consumed like a fine wine or excellent scotch, slowly savoring the flavor.  Having let things slip a little longer than intended I started reading it again, this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me.  This time things flowed somewhat better for me.  The individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone.  While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me why both can be so strong.Rating this one is extremely complex.  Some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have; others flow over you, whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later.  Because I wasn't touched by all, I call this a very strong 4 star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a 5 star book.

Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love.As oppposed to most books containing the word ""Prophet"" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading ""just one more section.""

I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to. I suppose I could at least explain why I find this book to be so unique.First of all this book covers most all of life's complex issues in the simplest fashion, and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation. Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself.  I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret  like I did,  I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the ""Urantia Book"" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. ""The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained."" ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity.

Kahlil Gibran managed to immigrate to NYC with his mother and siblings.  Gibran's personal life and his early death, his exotic looks and ability to both write and paint is what attracted me to read his masterpiece ""The Prophet"".  It is a mystic story, written in verse, less than 100 ages long with a dozen fantastic paintings that remind of magical realism in painting.  The book is a manifest on how to live, love, work, dress, embrace joy and sorrow, accept righteousness and mankind far from perfection.  It is a book of duality that in the most beautiful language a young philosopher teaches the ways to live life.  No matter what world, culture, continent or country one comes from,this verse is universal.  If anything, this piece of work has compelled me to seek out other of Gibran's work.

Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer ""dwell in the solitude of your heart"" so they ""live in your lips.""As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his ""ship arrives"" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.""Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?""The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: ""Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.""Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as ""her young prophet.""  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.""But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night."" ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review",5,The Invisible Revealed,1117411200,"05 30, 2005"

It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it.

Rereading it I feel vague inspiring feeling, and the other a kind of vague repulsion. I see many many readers are inspired by the work. I myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of Whitman and Zarathustra, but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter.I believe the most famous section of the work of twenty- six poetic essays is the one on 'Love""Here is some of this:""Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;For love is sufficient unto love.When you love you should not say, ""God is in my heart,"" but rather, I am in the heart of God.""And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.I am reminded when I read this of Bellow's description of the healer in 'Seize the Day' Dr. Temkin. On the one hand he says and thinks that it is phony  , and on the other he hears certain things and says ' True , True.'.I must admit my reaction remains mixed.

But ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who've gone to some great vacation spot.Sure, they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there.Because of the way this book is written, some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word.I wish we could award more than five stars.

Having loved poetry and free verse most of my life I was struck with vivid beauty in the simplicity of the words that graced my ears that night.  Kahlil Gibran in his day was renowned for his prose and how he carried it with the same simplicity that met my ear that night.  In his finest work he left an indelible mark on my soul, not just for his words but how his words and their importance can change to the reader throughout their life.  Regardless of religion, social preference or upbringing his words have the ability to stir the soul and to channel emotion to a strong degree.  Once a gift for my late mother in her dying days it remains not a pillar of strength but a pedestal on life.

The words go together beautifully and express fundamental truths of life in a way that drives the core belief home to me regardless of how I feel when I read them.  Gibran's statement that &quot;...your children are not your children...&quot; has helped me many times as my four children (two still in college) were aimed by the Archer on the infinite target with a reluctant bow.The wisdom of Gibran's prophet is practical.  The practicality of The Prophet lies in the refinements of Gibran's words to express the prophet's instructions in as few words as possible.  He has done this through careful use of similitude.

There is insight and wisdom on every page. 25 years after someone first leant me a copy, it seems to have more relevance to life's fundamental challenges than ever.Kahlil Gibran tells the story of Almastafa's departure from the city of Orphalese. As he leaves, the prophet (Almastafa) shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience. ""Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding"", ""Work is love made visible"", ""And think not that you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course"".However ""The Prophet"" is much more than a few inspiring self-help quotes.

Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, ""Speak to us of Children.""And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.",5,lyrically evokes your finest self,1100995200,"11 21, 2004"

I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that!  Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, 'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.'The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you.  On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of 'The Prophet' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his 'home'.MarriageChildrenGivingEating and DrinkingWorkJoy and SorrowCrime and PunishmentFreedomReason and PassionPainTeachingFriendshipGood and EvilPrayerPleasureReligionDeathSo many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!I'm not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible.  I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen.  But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133",5,Words of Wisdom for Everyone,1395792000,"03 26, 2014"

To write a better review I would need to refresh myself on Eastern or Middle Eastern mysticism;Persian more specifically,Sufism and also the background of Kahlil Gibran.What I can say is that these small stories or parables or fables are Zen-like; thought-provoking and instructive. I loved this book when I read it and I wrote one of my (still) best poems while I was in the state of mind this book put me in. (I'm positive it was just after I turned 16 because I have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a Friday night football game in the distance from the high school...and not wanting to go to another football game because I had to free my friend from the outside port-a-potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out....and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out. She did the same thing I would do.Anyone of any age can enjoy this book,I just wish I had a copy around so I could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review. Of course I'm sure I would have read it more than the one time I read it, if I did have the same copy I had when I was a teenager. I always read books I really like more than one time.This book and The Little Prince by Saint Exupery;Siddhartha,Demian and Steppenwolf (all by Herman Hesse) are books I read at the same time period and that I also don't have anymore,either because I gave my copy to someone;or,had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away, or,they just went the way of all things,as things go...in time (and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago...sigh.... 16 has also ""gone the way of all things""....but not completely!)Anyone who likes The Prophet (or any of the other titles I mentioned) can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read,or who has one of these books on their bookshelves;or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature. (It's  ""A Beatles Thing"". Not so much connected to The Beatles, but people who like the same type of music always like their friends more,when their friends like the same type of music that they like. Beatles, Zeppelin,Pink Floyd,Rob Zombie, Black Sabbath or Godsmack...Or Johann Sebastian Bach...writing or music,it's still art. And we just feel more comfortable with people who have interests or feelings or an intellect similar to our own. ....Aesthetic magnetism is a vibration more in tune with the spirit;and everyone is in love with their soul-mate(s)...to have common ground; or be in sympathy with one another on a deeper level than the common plane of the inescapable movements of the mundane.)....Anyone reading The Prophet,and finding themselves on common ground with the author,will find gratification,and will know exactly what I mean in what I wrote in this short review.",5,I read this just after I turned 16,1383609600,"11 5, 2013"

For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.  The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times.  The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.Victoria Tarrani",5,How to live and accept life.,1018396800,"04 10, 2002"

The themes discussed include love, family, friendship, freedom, etc. This is one of those classsics that one must own and read every once in a while, for the wisdom in these words is bound to make every reader a better, completer person. It is a spiritual prose, full of deep insight and inspiration for one and all.Some qoutes that I particularly like:And ever it has been that love knows not his own depth until the hour of separation.When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep.Work is love made visible.Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy can it contain.Your house is your larger body.And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than thier misdeeds.For reason, ruling alone is a force confining;And passion, unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction.Your pain is breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.For self is a sea, boundless and measureless.For vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.In longing for your giant self lies your goodness and that longing is in all of you.Trust your dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.",5,"Deep thoughts, simple words!",1128124800,"10 1, 2005"

A27XUU2DXILHYZ,000100039X,"Wayne S. Walker ""Home School Book Review""",11,40,"""The Prophet"" is Almustafa, called ""the chosen and the beloved,"" who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as ""Prophet of God"" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which ""the Prophet"" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of ""inspirational fiction"" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, ""the Prophet"" says, ""Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'""  Jesus said, ""You shall know THE truth"" (John 8:32), and, ""I am the way, THE truth, and the life"" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a ""spiritual masterpiece,"" so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, ""Ugh.""  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, ""It's all Greek to me,"" but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were ""all Greek"" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet ""brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes.""  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what ""the Prophet"" says about clothes.  ""Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.""  Oh, by the way, even as simply ""poetry"" it just doesn't do anything for me.  It is not a book that I would recommend to anyone under any circumstances.",1,it doesn't make good nonsense,1325116800,"12 29, 2011"

A2INDDW3XYFFV1,000100039X,W. Sean McLaughlin,14,17,"Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of prosaic poetry.  Despite being a native-born Arabic speaker, Gibran wrote The Prophet in English, ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation.The work's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey.  The words that flow from the prophet's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life.  Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as ""On Friendship"", ""On Pain"" and ""On Death.""  What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest.  The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity.The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating.  Amazingly, Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages, making it a very quick and easy read.  Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran's words.The Prophet, which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece, is a timeless literary classic.

A7FJVRLMG5BF9,0001024388,,6,6,"'The Moon of Gomrath' is the wild magical sequel to 'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen', set in Alderley Edge in Cheshire of the present day but harking back to the days of Middlearth. Both these stories have a very Tolkienish way about them, it is an interesting exercise to compare and contrast the characters as they are introduced. It is a pity that Garner's books, faring less well than 'The Hobbit', dropped off the literary radar in the 1980's, but with the benefit of Potter power they are now back in style with new artwork on the cover.Garner's special art is to take a basic swords-and-sorcery story and elevate it into a poetry-and-powers myth with gritty heroes and terrifying villains who hard to defeat and not always easy to spot. This story of Colin and Susan's second adventure is aimed at a slightly older audience than the Weirdstone, has Susan in the lead role, and has more depth and menace along with some sly humour. The Morrigan is back, not yet at the height of her powers, but ready for revenge. The elves are suffering and dying from the pollution caused by Man: they must retreat to cleaner, remoter places. The battles in magic and swordplay are more deadly and more personal and more realistic. The havoc and hard pace of war are felt in the prose, which is breathless and a little wild itself. The wizard Cadellin takes more of a back seat in this adventure but he does explain (in chapter four) why the coming of the 'Age of Reason' and industrialism was more of a coming of the age of Materialism and a retreat from Reason. Hence the great rift between our Man's world of material values, and the worlds of magic and the life of the spiritual values.Now as every parent knows, children's books have the power of forming the child's mind. (True even in the age of film and video, as books are both more personal and make mind-expanding demands on the imagination. Films just fill up whatever space is in your head, they do not create it. Books are not just good for you, they are more fun.) So with magical adventures being very much back in style now is a good time to get the various authors into some sort of order. So, without going back to the ancient Greeks, where does Alan Garner fit in? We can easily go back a century or so: F. Anstey (Vice Versa), George MacDonald (Princess and Curdie stories), and E. Nesbit (House of Arden, etc), Tolkien (Hobbit, Farmer Giles of Ham), C.S. Lewis (Narnia, the land of youth), Ursula K. LeGuin (Earthsea), and Alan Garner. And, as Rowling's ghost Peeves puts it, 'Wee Potty Potter', brings us up to date.So there are two main routes to magic. Anstey, MacDonald, Nesbit, Garner, and Rowling write a story that exercises magic in this world, and the two things collide with exciting degrees of chaos and depth. The results are serious or hilarious, or both. Garner manages to interface the two worlds with superior art. But a higher priced ticket will take you to a whole new world. Tolkien, Lewis, and LeGuin create whole worlds of their own and people it with new peoples - a fully magical world. The magic is integrated, truly part of the fabric of that world, not just added to make it fizz. One you are in, you belong there for a while. You return and your own world is now a little more magical. The whole range of literary forms is now possible, even super-possible as we no longer rely on supposed 'realism' to make the effects. They go beyond just making a magical talisman or two (some brilliantly done, others less so), and seeing 'what happens'. They make new countries and skies, new kingdoms and peoples, new languages and rules. Ultimately they are the suns and the others are the moons.",5,The Suns and Moons of Gomrath,1054252800,"05 30, 2003"

Old spells lying dormant begin to awake to help protect the Websters against the approaching evil forces of Woden the Gallows God.

Assisted by his faithfull companion Quoth the Raven Neil must help to protect the Websters in this their final stand against the forces of evil.This is the biggest and most complex of the three books, it also holds some of the major character developments, Ursula Webster's constant battle against her approaching insanity, Celidine Webster already insane but driven further into the black abyss of her mind by the death of her sister Veronica. Edie makes friends with a strange new character of the Gogus a small imp but the Gogus' loyalties are unclear. Neil has a new relationship with the mysterious Ghost Hunter who has now entered the museum. Quoth also has a dilema, he is offered a choice of staying with his beloved new master Neil and being punished by having his power of speach taken away and then finally being killed or returning to his old master Woden and becoming the evil Memory once more.Also Neil's father Brain Chapmann plays a much bigger role in the happening of the Wyrd Museum, confused and afraid by all the strange events occuring he stops looking after himself and begins to loose his temper a lot easier.This amazing story boils over and with the Museum its self turning against them our heros are loosing hope for the future of the world fast.

A319KYEIAZ3SON,0001035649,Mary Whipple,4,5,"Written as a ""play for voices"" for the BBC, this historic audiotape features the all-Welsh cast of the original BBC production from 1954. Richard Burton is the First Voice, which connects all the characters, played by twenty-eight men, women, and children. With perfect diction and the sense of character which only a great actor can convey, Burton rolls his R's, modulates his voice in pitch and intensity, and makes Thomas's poetry come fully alive--full of alliteration and various kinds of rhyme, with nouns and adjectives used as verbs to convey action and sense impressions simultaneously, and always a wry humor and honesty of feeling.Depicting one full day in the life of a small town in Wales, Thomas shows its motley residents as they awaken, perform their daily tasks, socialize, gossip, and daydream about the past that might have been and the future that may yet hold hope. When night falls and the residents retire, their losses and disappointments, along with their escapes into dreams, are given voice and poignancy. Polly Garter, with her numerous children by numerous fathers, dreams of Willie, a very small man who was the love of her life. Captain Cat, the blind bell-ringer, thinks of all the sailors he knew who died at sea. Mr. Pugh dreams of poisoning his wife, and young Gwenny, who has extorted pennies from the little boys who do NOT want to kiss her, plans for the next day and more pennies.The sound effects provide context for the drama without overpowering the narrative--a cock's crow, the clip-clop of horses, the bark of dogs, footsteps, the sea, bell buoys--and simple songs add to the realism and the sense of character and place. A mournful tune performed by Polly Garter in a minor key, as she remembers Willie and compares him to her other lovers, is beautifully sung by Diana Maddox, her clear, bell-like voice and almost palpable sadness making her one of the most memorable of the characters. A humorous children's singing game, sung by local school children, gives added realism, and little Gwenny's song to three very young boys is delightfully cheeky. Both enchanting and historically important, this memorable recording is worth seeking through Used sites or through amazon.co.uk--the best recording ever made of this wonderful ""play for voices.""

A2KALATI106D7J,000105001X,,14,19,"I am an avid reader of historical fiction, with the emphasis on the ""historical"" rather than the ""upthrust breast"" variety.  This catastrophe fails at both. I have read many many entries in this genre from the extraordinary to the putrid.  Lady of Hay falls somewhere below this last category.  As other readers have commented, this book is about 200 pages too long. The author has managed to confuse tedium with suspense by dragging out the conclusion long past the point of reader exhaustion.  Ms. Erskine's attempts to interweave the present day ""plot"" with historical narrative is a complete failure, as she only manages to disrupt both story lines resulting in a herky-jerky narrative flow that became quite annoying.  Compounding the problem, not a single character is the slightest bit sympathetic, and although I began the read with curiosity and interest, I ended feeling frustrated and cheated.  There are many red herrings dropped along the way that kept me reading, but I got no satisfaction at the end.  Why do we meet everyone's mother?  How many literary agents, photographers and editors need to be introduced by their names, only to drop from sight 20 pages later?  What about nurse Jeanne's foreshadowing of Matilda's illegitimate daughter ultimately giving her secret away resulting in calamity?  Did I miss that scene as I waded through episode after repetitive episode of modern Jo swooning in the rain as she ""channels"" Lady Matilda?  There are too many superfluous characters, seemingly all of whom are interested in and experienced with past life regression, who I kept expecting would have some role in the overall ""meaning"" of this morass, but they never did.  Not to mention, most of the players seem good candidates for Alcoholics Anonymous.  I cannot recall another novel which features wine, ale, scotch, Pimms and their ilk as the central focus in seemingly every scene.  The insane behavior of all principals appeared to be nothing more than the result of years of alcohol poisoning - a Medieval Lost Weekend.  I became so exasperated with their antics and cruel misdeeds that I actually found myself rooting for them all to be sent to the pokey or a rehab facility.This book was a major disappointment in every way.

By comparison it was natural to feel disappointed.  But over the years, listening to it several times on audio cassette it has grown on me.  The question you are asking, with so many SW books to select from should you read this one?  Yes.Luke falls in love.  The characters here appear in the Corellian Trilogy.  Bakura and Biotechnology used by the Ssi Ruuk is revisited in the ill intentioned NJO series.  Though it didn't seem to fit when I first read the book, the story here does fit nicely with the entire Expanded Universe.On the timeline I have this one at year 4.5 ANH.  The story takes place right after the battle at Endor in ROTJ.  Ben appears and tells Luke to go to Bakura.  Luke, at age 20 is in command and can only assemble a small force after the devastation of the battle they have just fought.  Naturally the Falcon, Han, Leia and Chewy are available to assist.The point of the plot is for the Rebels to help the Imperial garrison on Bakura defend against an invasion that is coming from the unknown regions.  The invaders are Large Reptilian creatures that, when they speak sound like flutes playing.  They use entechment to take the essence of sentient beings and place that essence inside their machines to run those machines.This is a book I recommend reading if you are now deciding to read the stories written for the classic era which starts with the Han Solo trilogy and ends with the Zahn Duology and the Dark Horse comic Union.  Fortunately, at this writing, Amazon.com had both new and used audio cassettes and paperbacks for sale.Audio Casette.  This is an abridged version that can be listened to in about 2  hours.

Sandahl,8,8,"This historically-arranged selection of poems about warfare and its effects on the human mind, body, and heart, covers nearly 200 years between the late 1700s and the 1960s. Produced in Britain, and read by two British actors, Paul McGann and Regine Candler, it concentrates on English poets, with short forays into works by American authors.Warhorse selections - &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; - are mixed with less well-known poems like &quot;The Dead Statesman&quot;, a surprising (at least to me) burst of post-WWI bitterness from Kipling. Glory and horror intertwine from the earliest works to the most recent, but horror dominates as the present approaches. Changes in attitudes about war and patriotism come to vivid life. The effect of hearing these works read aloud is almost one of traveling in time. Paul McGann reads the lion's share - not surprising with so masculine a subject matter-and is IMO much the better reader, tho Ms. Candler is strikingly effective in places.  The majority of works are from WWI - the period that produced so many gifted poets - and in them one hears older, strongly-held beliefs about Duty and Country clashing with the despairing fury engendered by the incomprehensible waste of trench warfare. McGann is able to bring understanding and force to everything from innocent jingoism to pity, from rage to transcendance, without forcing the material. His readings of WWII and Cold War pieces (Reed's &quot;Lessons of the War&quot;, Lowell's &quot;For the Union Dead&quot;, and McGough's &quot;Icarus Allsorts&quot; are remarkable) bring home the fear and ambivalence felt by a humanity realizing its power to destroy itself and the earth that supports it.",4,Evocations of War,970272000,"09 30, 2000"

His translations and teaching positions are not always mentioned, yet they are credentials that make his other works even more astounding!  The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone.  Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style.  I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created.  I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before.

Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar.

I had to read several parts more than once to be able to understand what it all really was about, and to understand which lenses where used.Still the book has some good parts, among them are the battlefield scenes.

A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0001055178,C. B Collins Jr.,0,0,"Historic fiction requires exceptional skills to capture character as well as time and place. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie certainly excels in this regard, reminding me of the skills of Hilary Mantel. The plight of a Crimean War surgeon comes alive in all its gore and misery and insanity. The tale is told through the eyes of the surgeon's brother-in-law, his off and on boyfriend and photographic assistant, and Myrtle, an orphan informally adopted by the family and mother of his children. The Crimean War offers a backdrop of incompetent diplomatic and military leadership dissolving into a nightmare of gore, horror, disease, dysentery, crime, and cruelty. Bainbridge captures the disorganized international disaster with many horrible bloody details, having her characters do the best they can to survive the catastrophe. Yet, Bainbridge captures more than just history, time, place, and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb. Early in the novel, Myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush, they float like dandelion seed up the wind-draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier. It is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time. The pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters. I almost think she wrote too little in this book. I would have loved to have the book twice as long. The character of Pompey Jones, the bisexual street urchin, is fascinating and I wish Bainbridge had written a novel just for this self-aware, self-assured, character to follow Master Georgie. Bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of Myrtle, and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover George Hardy. Myrtle and Pompey are both orphans, street wise, highly intelligent, and are recognized for their strengths by the Hardy family.George Hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden. As a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home, it appears that his service in the Crimean is somewhat of a penance, a sacrifice, for his sexuality. He strives to be the perfect son to his father, mother, and siblings, yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family. George Hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the Crimean War due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control. In some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the Victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation. George is contrasted with Pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality, recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women. The narrative of war is haunting, reminding me of the outstanding novels of Pat Barker about World War I. We read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body. It is the third narrator, Dr. Potter, George's brother-in-law that offers unique looks at all the other characters. Potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time. He lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident. Overall the book is excellent, a post-modern masterpiece, telling a complex tale from multiple points of view but never giving the `definitive' story behind the story.",5,An historic novel of personal proportions,1281225600,"08 8, 2010"

The 1840s in England do not come  alive quite as well for Ms. Bainbridge as the early 1900s of her The  Birthday Boys and Every Man for Himself.  This may be a result of the  narrative coming from different observers of the events, which perforce  must take the time to limn each separate narrator as he or she appears.  While this method succeeds quite powerfully in The Birthday Boys, with the  various members of the Scott expedition continuing the story from their  differing points of view, it does not work as well here.  Master Georgie  lacks the successive stream of events, as exists in The Birthday Boys,  which could hold together the differing shifts of narrative.However, the  story takes on an absorbing sense of urgency as the 1850s arrive and the  characters shift to the Crimea.  These later episodes certainly contain the  strongest writing in this work.  Ms. Bainbridge's descriptions of war are  chillingly gruesome, even though the focus is usually only upon the fringe  of battle itself, but seem at times to be lazily gloomy.  Certainly the  atrocities of the Crimean or any war merit the most horrid descriptions,  but aside from some poignant scenes, much of the horror is conveyed through  somewhat stock descriptions of the filth, disease, deprivations and  insanity that accompany every war.  Furthermore, neither the action nor the  characters, especially the title character who throughout remains shadowy  and elusive, seem to progress substantially during these latter stages of  the novel.All in all, this is still a very fine book, that perhaps  suffers only in comparison to the author's greater works.",4,"A step below the author's best, but still exceptional.",903657600,"08 21, 1998"

These are placed in the frame of the historical context leading to the war between England and Russia.

I thought it nonsense that an illiterate girl in nineteenth century Liverpool could never write such exquisite prose as evidenced in  this novel, and that this was a case of the authorial voice being too  strong.  As it happened, I couldn't have been more wrong.  This novel is  narrated by the close acquaintances of 'Master Georgie' (although some are  closer than others), starting with the illiterate Myrtle.  Immediately we  are drawn into the action, as this sequence of a photograph being taken  will resound throughout the novel.  'Master Georgie' is incredibly subtle,  and it is only by looking back over it that you begin to appreciate that  this is the most suitable of beginnings.  Here is where Myrtle begins on  her road to becoming a lady.  And what an unsavory road it is, as Myrtle's  help is initially required to cover up the manner in which George Hardy's  father has died, and leads to the bloody battlefields of the Crimea.  Also  assisting with the cover-up is the duck-boy and street urchin, Pompey Jones  and the pompous Dr. Potter, whose narrations are by far the best.  George  Hardy himself is an ambiguous figure, seen only through the eyes of others.  It may be a fault that we never really get to know him.  This is a novel  of cameras, carnality, and carnage.  The dreadful shadow of history is cast  upon it, with the famous charge of the Light Brigade lightly alluded to.  One almost expects to run into a lady with a lamp at every corner, but  fortunately, Bainbridge avoids this excess.  She takes events frozen in  time, such as the front cover's photograph, and brings them into life and  death, and maybe even beyond.  The camera never lies... Or does it?  Bainbridge fervently burrows into the psyche of characters, enabling them  to bring about apparitions vivid enough to be captured by film.  In my  mind's eye, I see Bainbridge pouring over ancient photographs from the  Crimea, trying to put names to faces and to see if she could walk around in  their bloody shoes.  She succeeds.  If I'd have been on 1998's Booker  panel, I know I would have placed Bainbridge before McEwan.

A12RI2CLUGCZ26,0001055178,"Philip Spires ""Author of two African novels s...",1,1,"At first glance Master Georgie by Beryl Bainbridge suggests it might be quite a light book, an easy read, a period piece set in the mid-nineteenth century. This would be wrong. Master Georgie is no safe tale of country house manners, of marriages imagined by confined, embroidering young women. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility.Master Georgie is a surgeon and photographer, and the book is cast in six plates - photographic plates, not chapters. Death figures throughout. From start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book's characters. We begin with Mr Moody, dead in a brothel bed, his host of minutes before in shock. Later we move to the Crimean War, where the carnage is graphic, extensive and apparently random. And even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering.The book uses multiple points of view. We see things Master Georgie's way. Myrtle, an orphan he takes in, adds her perspective. The fussy geologist, Dr Potter, imprints his own version of reality. And still there are less than explained undercurrents, undeclared motives which affect them all. Thus, overall, Master Georgie is a complex and ambitious novel. Though it is set in a major war, the backdrop is never allowed to dominate. The characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions, but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting.But we also never really get to know these people. Myrtle, perhaps, has the strongest presence. She has a slightly jaundiced, certainly pragmatic approach to life. But even she finds the privations of wartime tough. Why the characters of Master Georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself. And ultimately this was my criticism of Beryl Bainbridge's book. While the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking, I found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives. The beauty of the prose, however, more than made up for any shortcoming. The language created the mixed world of mid-nineteenth century politeness and juxtaposed this with the visceral vulgarities of soldiering and the general struggle of life.

Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents.

It's ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George's father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George's sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It's like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It's the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got.

A37F1G84K35FCZ,0001055178,taking a rest,10,10,"Ms. Beryl Bainbridge writes Historical Fiction with as much skill as any writer, and much better than others who attempt the genre. Her stories rarely have definitive separations between what actually happened, and what might have happened to the characters she creates. The Crimean War is the setting this time, and while historically noteworthy is not as familiar as some of her other subjects, like The Titanic, or the doomed Scott Expedition to the South Pole. What is consistent is her ability to jump about through time periods without ever losing credibility. Each of her books reads as if a unique pen is behind each one. The hand of course is the same, however the moods created are remarkably singular.The character that is the book's title is a complex human study, or if you prefer, a very intricate person but occupied with a mind and personality as muddled, as it is diverse. A grotesque death scene is the entrance for one of the narrator's of the book, an individual that would have lived as a street urchin but for chance, and an ambiguous bit of goodwill. A second street personality with many more wiles and flexible conduct also becomes a member of Master Georgie's entourage. This second narrator has a unique view of events, as he is close when Master Georgie requires, for the latter's sexuality is repressed at best. These are just two people who eventually head to the middle of The Crimean War, and the question that keeps shadowing the reader is why?Escape from the latter half of 19th century London is an easy answer for George, but what of the others? Taking a trip toward an impending war as George's groupies is one matter, staying in the midst of a war is much more puzzling. This is one of the most difficult of Ms. Bainbridge's books that I have read. Previous works have often served as a metaphor for the time they occupy, or the closing act in a World that is about to undergo great disruptive change.

A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0001055283,,1,1,"Be aware that this audio tape is an abridged version of the book, so it's missing some material. The most important parts are here, though, and if you're a fan of audio books and tapes, which a lot of people like to listen to while they're commuting or travelling in their cars, this one is fine if you don't mind the fact that it's not the entire book. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it is an abridged version.I had a few other comments about the story. I don't read much fiction these days, sticking mostly to history and nonfiction, but I made an exception for this novel since I am a student and teacher of a couple of Japanese martial arts, and I'd absorbed some small knowledge about things like geishas during my studies. And I'd heard about how good the novel was.I wasn't disappointed. I found Golden's book about a geisha during the 1930s, when the geisha tradition and culture was already dying, to be an accurate, detailed, and well written story about the life of what could have been a typical geisha. For me it's reminiscent of Yasunari Kawabata's famous novel, Snow Country, a bittersweet story about a love affair between a wealthy Tokyo playboy and a provincial geisha in a remote mountain town. Kawabata won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1968. The bittersweet quality derives from the fact that the geisha knows that although by most standards she is still young, she is past her prime and is one of the last of a dying breed.Like Kawabata's novel, Golden's novel sensitively and realistically portrays the world of the geisha during a time when it was already waning. Golden shows that, contrary to western stereotypes of geishas as ordinary prostitutes, they were highly cultured and educated, trained in music, poetry and the arts, and more than able to hold their own and intelligently converse on many subjects with their often wealthy and powerful clients.I understand this is Golden's first book. It's a fine debut by a new author and I hope it won't be his last. It will be interesting to see what he does next after such a spectacular debut.By the way, an interesting little side note here. I've studied a little Japanese, and Japanese is replete with epithets, slang, and various and sundry derogatory words relating to people's mental, moral, and physical shortcomings. One funny aspect of this is how reptiles and especially turtles come in for a lot of abuse. Calling someone a turtle, for example, means you're saying they're slow or unintelligent. And if you call someone a ""deb game,"" it translates literally as ""a turtle with buckteeth."" But the actual meaning is a ""peeping tom.""",4,Good audio version,1137888000,"01 22, 2006"

A1WX42M589VAMQ,0001393774,Mir,10,10,"I cannot tell you how many tears I've shed listening to these songs and how many prayers I've sent up in response to these lyrics. I can tell you that if you love the Lord, this album should be part of your collection--if you can find it. I still have my original LP, the music book, and the songs in various Keith collections.There isn't a dud on here, but the ones that shine the most for me include his rendition of the 23rd psalm (still my fav of all versions of this most beloved of psalms). A friend of mine from my previous church, the pianist/music teacher, used to play this when we got together for fellowship, her on piano and me singing, and it's still just the most beautiful adaptation in popular music of ""The Lord Is My Shepherd."" Keith's vocals are full of emotion and true spiritual fervor and faith. Astonishing.Another favorite is ""How Majestic Is Your Name"" (Psalm 8), a song I occasionally sing a capella when moved by the night sky or a sunset or some other wonder of nature. ""When I consider the heavens, the work of they fingers...""  Keith's sense of wonder at God shines through this semi-meditative but passionate song.On the darker, heavier side, you get a ""spiritual"" called ""Oh God, our Lord"" which is great to sing, but not an easy subject to digest with lyrics such as:""Who you gonna throw in the lake of fire, O God our Lord?Who you gonna throw when the flames get higher, O God our Lord?The Devil and the man with the dark desire, O God our Lord.""Keith really gets into it, his voice low and heavy at times, high and full of pain at others.Another deep, difficult song describes those times when we feel in need of assistance and we can only cry to God out of our frustration and helplessness:""My flesh is tired of seeking God,But on my knees I'll stay.I want to be a pleasing child,Until that final day.My mind is full of many thoughtsThat clutter and confuse.But standing firm, I will prevail,In faith that I'll be used.Amen! I'm asking once again.Won't you help me my friend, Lord Jesus.""Keith's voice is beautiful in those lines of pleading..""won't you help me, my friend, Lord Jesus.""""There Is A Redeemer"" is a simple melody, simple earnest lyrics, and is so ""singable"" that it has earned a place in hymnals and worship services across the land. ""There is a Redeemer, Jesus, God's own son. Blessed Lamb of God...Messiah! Holy One. Thank you, oh, my Father, for giving us your Son and leaving Your Spirit till your work on Earth is done."" It's a basic expression of gratitude and worship and it holds up.""Jesus is Lord of All"" and ""You Are The One"" and ""The Promise Song"" are peppy and bouncy and full of joy and affirmation of truth. From the last of those we get this:""Oh if you keep My word,I'll make you as a tree,Planted by the streams of life,If you'll submit to me.And if you love the hateful ones,Who mistreat you constantly,The book of life shall bear your name,If you love your enemies.""""Glory Lord Jesus"" is effervescent and energetic and will have you with your hands up in the air.Like his version of Psalm 23, Keith's version of ""Holy, Holy, Holy"" is part of the reason why that is among my most favorite of all classic hymns. I never tire of it.Those are most of the songs, and I think you will find pleasure and an encouragement to worship here. These are truly ""Songs for the Shepherd"" that all the sheep can treasure.

The first and only church i have seen this hymnal is is ""Center Point Independent"" in Center Point, AL, near Birmingham. This hard cover red book was the standard hymnal wed'e use every morning, and Pastor Baker would always start us with ""Good Old 69"", ""Safely Through Another Week."" We would praise God for keeping us for another week, i was also introduced to this hymn this way and have not heard it any place else.As i've only seen it at one church, i cannot tell you what other churches or denominations ""Great Hymns of the Faith"" is used at (some other reviews to give us a heads up would be interesting), but it appears to be a non-denominational hymnal produced by Zondervan Singspriation with a more or less Baptist persuasion. There are topical as well as song title and composer indexes in the back, as well as topical Bible chapters and responsive readings. Also included are patriotic songs such as ""America the Beautiful"" and ""The Star Spangled Banner."" This hymnal would work great for a church of any denomination that truly seeks to praise God with His word uncompromised. It is filled with lots and lots of ""familiar favorites"" as well as new ones. I discovered lots of new ones just this afternoon i neither knew the words nor tunes to, and i thought i knew alot of Baptist hymns! These hymns tell it like it is, and are a great way to understand the gospel even if you never pick up a Bible.Get this hymnal for family singing around the piano (does anyone do that anymore?) or for the new church your starting (if you want the word of God, that is.)

A33LL5AOUVXQUE,0001473123,Brett,4,8,"First of all, it's important to understand that the author penned this reference book in 1919. Quite a lot has changed in the world in the last 90 years. As even he notes, the meaning of the book of Revelation was to be sealed until the time that it would become pertinent. Which is to say, nobody would quite get it until the events start to unfold and it all suddenly makes sense. I highly doubt a book that was written before commercial airplanes existed would present the best explanation for events happening in a world dominated by smartphones, the internet, debit cards, and did I mention commercial airlines?Be that as it may, it still explains the basics of eschatology fairly well, altho in a very culturally quaint way. In spite of its lack of modern sophistication it gets the main historical points right. But if you want to REALLY understand the end times prophecies, you'll need to dig a lot deeper than this book. And this is essentially the same as 90% of all eschatological reference materials, which mostly explain (wrongly) that the Antichrist will be a jew and will be accepted and outwardly benevolent by jews for a time. Or conversely, that he will be a pope and the allegedly revived Roman Empire will be the one world religion and government that will persecute the jews and christians.The problem with this author, having written his book so long ago, is that his world wasn't aware of the huge upsurge of Islamic antagonism that would become prevalent in the future. If you read this book, I don't think you'll notice a single reference to Islam. But if you study Islamic prophecy, you'll see a huge parallel with the book of Revelation. However, the good guys and the bad guys are on completely different sides depending on which religion you're studying. While there are always ""two sides to any story"", there will be only one right side in this epic. Christianity claims Jesus is the son of God. Islam claims Jesus is a prophet (of lower importance than Muhammed) and that he (Jesus) will return in the End Times to proclaim Christianity to be false. Islam says that Jesus is a muslim who was never crucified.In reality, Islam is the Beast. The Islamic Madhi to come is the Antichrist (probably from Fatima, Italy). A muslim 'jesus', as predicted in Islamic prophecy, is the False Prophet. None of that is mentioned in this book. But then, it's rarely mentioned in any book written more than 5 years ago. Since the assumptions of the main characters is off, much of the supporting information of this book is also off base.I'm not saying don't read this book. I'm just saying it's not all accurate.

A19TQ9PZR8AO3H,0001473727,Nat L. Vaira,3,5,"Clarence Larkin was ahead of his day in that he wrote about the Feasts of the Lord and wrote about the prophetic significance of each of these Feast Days. The Feast Days are mentioned in scripture to be kept by Israel forever. Each of these days have significance in God's plan of salvation for Israel and for the world.He also says Christ was crucified on 30 AD. Most churches use 31 or 33 AD because they don't understand that Christ, according to Daniel 9, was to be crucified in the middle of the week. That would be a Wednesday. If you were look at a Hebrew calendar for 30 AD you would see that Nisan 14 (Passover) fell on a Wednesday that year. The disciples were trying to bury Christ before the holy day (1st Day of Unleavened Bread) that happened to follow Passover. Thus they buried him as Wednesday was coming to an end at sunset. They buried him as Wednesday was coming to an end near sunset. 3 days and 3 nights later was Saturday, The Sabbath Day, as it was about to come to an end at sunset. That is when Christ rose. He rose on Sabbath, just before Sunday was about to begin. Christ rose on Sabbath, and not on Sunday. Christ is Lord of the Sabbath Day, as He said in scripture. The Lord's Day is Sabbath, not Sunday. God blessed the 7th Day in Scripture, and made it holy. Man cannot make Sunday holy. Man has no authority to change God's blessed day to Sunday. Sunday anciently was a day when people worshipped the Sun. God made heaven and earth in 7 days according to Genesis, and blessed the 7th Day, and rested from His work. This is His creation. He, as Creator, has every right to tell man when He wants us to worship Him as a community. That is the 7th Day Sabbath Day. John 1 tells us that Christ is the Word, and it was the Word that was with God and the Word was God. Thus Christ created the Sabbath day, and pronounced it holy, and also called Himself the Lord of the Sabbath. Man is wrong to pronounce Sunday the Lord's Day when it never was. Christ said that He was Lord of the SABBATH. He still is. Sabbath is the Lord's Day, and always has been.Study the Feasts of the Lord. The Sabbath is mentioned as one of those feast days. And, notice, these day are called by God THE FEASTS OF THE LORD, not the Feasts of the Jews! Also notice that in Geneses, the 7th Day was created for man (as Christ also said). Adam and Eve were present, but no Jew existed at that time.  THE FEAST DAYS OF GOD ARE FOR MAN, made to reveal the plan of God as revealed in His Holy Calendar.

If you have some knowledge of the Bible you will find this book offers some additional insight that is not in other commentaries. This author is an inspiration to me to dig deeper in the word of God.  Because it is written in 1929 do not let that cause you to think it is old school and outdated.  It is not!  I am still reading it as it is too much information to ingest in a couple days.  The book starts off with an explanation that the Bible was written ""for all classes of people and for our learning"" and the Bible is not addressed to all people in general. Part of the Bible is to addressed to the Jews, Gentiles and to the Church which consititute the three classes. Mr. Larkin gives his explanation of the ages and dispensations. He continues on to explain the age of the earth that in Gen 1:3-31 was the restoration of the earth to its original condition before it was made ""formless and void"" and submerged in water and darkness and how there is millenniums of time that science may require for the formation of the earth as a planet. His teachings throughout the book are thought-provoking and shed some light on questions I have had such as election and free-will, Heaven and Hell, Judiaism and Christianity.

A2VN986E5KR1NV,0001498517,,4,4,"Chuck Girard, one of the true pioneers in modern Christian music and one of the founders of the band Love Song, released THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES back in the mid-1980s.  From that time onward, it has remained one of my favorite albums of all time.There is an electricity that surrounds each song...an amazingly powerful sense of significance both lyrically and musically.  Many of the songs have an unusual prophetic edge, and the message here holds up very strong today, nearly 20 years later.  Containing powerful biblical truths, these lyrics are both weighty and accessible, lending each individual song stand-alone strength and also a cohesion that flows with all of the other songs.The album is primarily a mixture of anthemic epics and topnotch Eagles/Beach Boys Cali country-rock. As varied as the sonic textures and instrumentation are, the overall flow here is very ""vertical"" and worship-inspiring.  The soaring title track builds into an electrifying trumpet solo by Phil Driscoll.  ""Kingdom Come"" is my favorite track among favorite tracks; it's a piercing heartcry straight from God reflecting His desire to manifest His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, on earth, as it is in heaven...now. Musically, it's pretty adventurous, harder edged, yet inviting. It remains a spirit-stirring triumph after many repeated listens.Other thrilling anthems include ""Soldiers of the Lion"" and ""The Power and the Glory.""  Girard has a warm, versatile voice that is very reminiscent of Brian Wilson, and he handles these big songs with both conviction and aplomb.And, it's impossible to resist the countrified stomp of ""Blessed Be the Name of My Rock,"" and the folky ease of ""Walk as I Walk.""Girard talk-sings ""Don't Shoot the Wounded,"" a song that is deeply personal and incredibly convicting.  It speaks of the sad truth that oftentimes, ""The Christian army is the only one that shoots its wounded soldiers.""  It's a call straight out of Galatians 6:1, and it resonates deeply.There are no weak moments here.  It's intense and powerful album, that continually convicts, refreshes, and exhorts. If you've never heard it, don't miss it now.",5,Powerfully prophetic and relevant,1124150400,"08 16, 2005"

For years they have ranted against society & tried to set little christian worlds apart from the rest of us (as if it was really possible to totally cut themselves from the rest of the world).  But now, not content with living alienated, dull, boring, repressed & illogical lives themselves, they now conspire with their dim-witted acolytes to take away from our children one of the few unsoiled fun holidays of the great American tradition.  Halloween is a far better holiday than Christmas.  During Halloween we have no choice but to trust our fellow human beings as we allow our children to partake of the merryment of the season.  Christmas pays hollow homage to doing good deads to others - in practice, Christmas good deeds are all done towards close family & friends only.  Precious few outside do partake of the kindness despite all platitudes & pompous verbosity to the contrary.  But during Halloween we are all forced to trust others & to live up to that trust ourselves.  We care for and enliven the joy of strangers & their children.  We allow for their exhuberance & they reciprocate.  Neighbors who for 364 days of the year (Christmas included) may pretend you do not exist, now amicably talk with you & join in the joy.  There is no more socially-minded civic holiday in the American tradition than Halloween.  But the thought pattern this book exemplifies sees only evil & darkness in Halloween.  They come up with all sorts of suggestions on how to ensnare a future generation of children away from the holiday into the clutches of their mindset.  By all means, read the book yourself to make up your own opinions on it.  However, I encourage you to read it for free from a library or internet website rather than paying for it.

It has been listen to so much that the tape is worn and in bad shape. You have to have full volume to even hear it sometimes. I remember sitting in the car listening to it rather that going inside some place with my dad. The song playing was about Isabel the pig. &quot;Isabel is a pig with a ring in her snout. You can dress Izzy up, but you can't take her out. She will jump in the middle of a big muddle, because Isabel is pig.&quot; All the trappings in the world, don't look pretty when you act like a fool or put on a pouty face.My favorite song is &quot;The School of the Fool.&quot; The guy in the song was &quot;A first class, A+, student in the school of the fool.&quot; He was mean, lazy, etc.&quot;Go to the Ant&quot; is really a well known saying from the Bible. It is also something we should be paying attention to. The ant doesn't have a boss looking over her shoulder. She does the work anyway. She works all day. Not like us. Some do may be, but most work a five, six, seven, eight, nine hour shift. Not from son up 'till sun down. &quot;Are you responcible? Do you ever do a job without being told to? Or are you the lazy kind? And you mother and your father always have to scold you?&quot; &quot;Go to the ant, observe her. See how she works all day. And she doesn't even have a captain to tell her what to do, but she works hard anyway. Go to the ant, and listen. Tell me does she complain. She is God's illustration of organisation. God made her, now you immitate her. Go to the ant.&quot; &quot;Well, there was a poor irrisponcible sluggard who slept when there was work to be done. Too late he realized his foolish behavior and poverty struck him like a man with a gun. Go to the ant.&quot;I still find my self singing the song about the seven things God hates. &quot;There are six things, even seven, that the Lord, that he cannot stand: Proud looking eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that thinks of wicked things to do, feet that run to evil do, anyone who loves to lie about others, and one who causes trouble with his brothers.&quot; &quot;God hates things that we should hate too.&quot;&quot;From the lips of the little ones, he has ordained his praise.&quot; &quot;You made man a little lower than the angels, put things under his feet.&quot;&quot;Talk to me. Show me that you care. Talk to me. Listen to what I say. Talk to me. There's so much we can share. I know you love me when you talk to me.&quot; &quot;He always takes the time to talk to me.&quot;I remember times when I didn't care much for Christian music (didn't know much about it either), the music was too dull, but (little children music it may be), music like this appeal to me ten times what the rest did.The beats great, the words are not only great, but (sorry to about half the bands in the world) they are understandable. The message is clear and it is clearly benificial rather that to your potential downfall as some music now a days is.I highly recommend this tape, whether you are getting it for a little kid like my mom was, or you're getting it for yourself.

And that is just the start of the fun in this highly imaginative story in which the author really gets into the clourful imagination of the prep school boys.I loved Jennings as a child, and I am not so old that the language of the books was very dated when I read them! So don't let that put you off. Indeed I think the dated prep school slang of Jennings really adds to the charm of these books which refelct on a slice of life that we all might like to have back.The books are often hilarious.

A1VF0102Z9VITO,0001632108,Joseph M. Reninger,0,0,"This children's book is full of stories of the fairy folk, interacting both with each other and with the human world, mostly with children. The locations vary from elven villages to children's bedrooms to dark forests to fine gardens. The tales are told with simplicity and directness. They aren't so poetic or vivid but are enjoyable enough.Many stories have some moral point to make that is reinforced by the last line, e.g. ""He learned that laziness left him in lots of trouble. You don't want to be lazy, do you?"" Those endings seem a little heavy-handed and undercut the storytelling a bit. The moral is usually pretty obvious and does not need underlining.Other stories are tales of whimsy and imagination that are charming but predictable. One story tells of a fairy party that almost goes awry because the tables and chairs are not delivered. One friend plants mushroom seeds which seems unhelpful to the party thrower. Then the mushroom sprout up just in time for the midnight festivities, making perfect tables and chairs for the little folk. The ending isn't really a surprise.

It continues on with the boy and his pony, Little Black. This time they meet up with a circus and Little Black runs ahead to the circus people to impress them with his tricks. When the circus master Mr. Bruno wants to make Little Black a part of his circus the boy wanders off near by and feels lonely and left out.A good book for reading once the child gets the hang of the owner's name, Mr. Bruno. I'd say this was a level higher in reader than ""Little Black, A Pony"". A fun, wholesome story but I find it a little over the top. The story isn't very believable and gets a bit carried away. The illustrations are also very bright, bold and a bit gaudy. I suspect in keeping with the circus theme. Children will enjoy the book and any ""Dr. Seuss"" book from the sixties is better than the current batch being published but I do prefer Farley's first book for this series, ""Little Black, A Pony"".

Dumb-talk for children, with a confusing message to boot. The book starts with a cliche: ""Once upon a time, there was a doctor"" and it's all downhill from there. The second sentence insults the intelligence of any reader, regardless of age: ""The M.D. meant that he was a doctor and that he knew a lot."" (!) Upon Dr. Dolittle's arrival in Africa, readers are exposed to one of the worst misrepresentations ever seen in a children's book: ""The Doctor found hundreds and thousands of very sick monkeys. He made all the monkeys come to be vaccinated [Three days later] Doctor Dolittle saw that none of the monkeys were sick any more. They were all well! His vaccinations had cured them all."" I am fairly certain that even in 1920, vaccinations provided immunity against future disease rather than curing an existing ailment. The illustrations by Philip Wende? Creepy. The monkeys look like aliens or possibly Australopithecus.Compared to modern children's literature, the message here is heavy-handed and politically incorrect. The African savages are violent and dumb. The King sleeps in a bed decorated with skulls. Fearful of the unknown, he imprisons Dr. Dolittle as a medicine-man along with his band of animals. Even more fearful of being cursed--with mumps, no less! Who subsidized this printing, the CDC?--the king is tricked into freeing them. Score one for the colonial powers! The story in its original form, like those featuring that other simian Curious George, will set off a modern PC Geiger counter. And this version doesn't even include the infamous white-face incident from the original Story of Doctor Dolittle! Finally, and just like the Man with the Yellow Hat, Dr. Dolittle brings home a souvenir from the old country in the form of a live pet.In summary, even if you like the original story in all its early 20th century glory, this version will disappoint. Everyone else will be disgusted straightaway. Worst of all, this book (as published in 1967) carries the Random House seal of approval in the form of the Cat in the Hat-emblazoned ""Beginner Books"" imprint, leading some to believe this book might have been worth having. It wasn't then and it isn't now.[Hugh Lofting's Travels of Doctor Dolittle (Adapted for Beginning Readers) is inexplicably offered in at least four Product Listings here on Amazon.

This morning there were a pile of about twenty books on the floor and he wanted me to read every one of them. For the most part, he would lose interest after a page or two, but a few he listened to right until the end. Those books deserve a write-up.That he listened all the way through The Berenstains' B Book surprised me. I did lose interest after about the fourth page, but he was loving all those Bs, so I read it to the end. This is a silly little book, which, not shockingly emphasizes the letter B. It becomes quite a tricky tongue-twister long before you reach the end of the book. I couldn't really tell you what specifically my three-year-old liked about the book, but he did really enjoy it.The illustrations feature the funnel-snouted animals of the Berenstains -- cute and colorful, but not easily recognizable, and, therefore not my favorite style.

By the time you've finished reading the book you've been asked if `you'd rather have a feather or a bushy tail behind', whether you'd rather be a minnow or a whale, a hammer or a nail.This story is told in rhyme, the standard for all Dr. Seuss books. The pictures are all bright and colorful, and the book is quite straightforward; it comes right out and asks you things, no beating around the bush for it!

The portray the gravity-free environment of the space ship's interior during the voyage, and they also show that the gravity on the lunar surface is much less than that on Earth.The book is illustrated in the typically appealing Berenstain Bears style. Particularly fun is the orange, green, and purple-colored rocket ship used by the intrepid space travelers. And the rhymes are equally fun.

The author is in fact Fiona Cummings who was commissioned to write another series of Noddy Stories under the Enid Blyton trademark. Dame Enid gets full credit on the cover and title page but you have to look on the publisher's details page (ISBN etc) to see that the story is in fact by Fiona Cummings.The story is written 40 years after the classic 24 title Noddy Series &quot;All Aboard for Toy Land&quot;.  A good example of the original is &quot;Noddy and Tessie Bear&quot; The fate of the new generation &quot;Mr Plod and the Stolen Bicycle&quot; is very similar to what has happened to Pooh Bear and Tigger in recent years. We have gone from the quaint Edwardian language of the original to the uncomplicated, perhaps, trivialized language of the contemporary versions.We have lost all of the &quot;Englishness&quot; of the original.  Strange vocabulary and sentence structures could be off-putting to children used to a cartoon/comic dominated diet. Old fashioned concepts such as manners, politeness and deference have been expunged.The illustrations have also been sanitized. Compared to the pictures in the original series they have lost their bright hard edges and have drifted into a more pastelly palette.Although the original series of Noddy could be heavy going for some of today's young readers, we have seen how JK Rowling has demonstrated that the reading appetites of young readers can include sophisticated content.Look out for the &quot;Noddy Classic Library&quot; and avoid the &quot;Toy Town Stories&quot;, As bedtime stories go,  the Classic Noddy will give you a 30-minute passage to dreamland. In contrast the modern versions like &quot;Mr Plod and the Stolen Bicycle&quot; would be lucky to give you 3 minutes of story.

I loved looking at all of the cat illustrations, especially the ones that resembled the grey tabby I had at home (there are lots in this book). I checked this book out often until I moved on to teen novels as I grew up. Then one day during the library book fair, I snuck amongst the shelves to try to find this book again. It was gone! And of course I could not remember the name or even much of what it looked like. Now this was before the internet was big, so I was left to wonder and hopelessly look in that and other local libraries for the book I once loved as a child. I soon gave up. Then last year, a random flash of memory inspired me to continue my search. Although I now had the wonder of the internet to help me, I really had nothing to go on, except that it was a hardcover book, perhaps had a border on the front, it was about cats in a house and a there was a garden scene. That's it. So I looked and looked and came up with nothing again. So another year went by and I was going through my old books and I remembered again. I took to the internet for days, thinking of all the potential search words I could use. &#34;Cat hardcover book garden&#34;, or &#34;illustrated cats home book&#34;. I came upon another author who writes Americana-style cat books and calendars. I felt I was getting closer! I followed that trail, author after author, until finally, I found Lesley Anne Ivory and said...hmmm this looks familiar, but not quite right...wait... HERE IT IS! And yes, I had found it! After so long, so many years. About 20 years have passed since I've read this book. I was probably 7 when I first discovered it. And you cannot imagine how happy I was to finally find it and have it in my hands again! It is SUCH a cute book. I remember thinking it had way too much writing when I was younger and only wanted to look at picturebooks. But I reread the story and it was quite cute! Very descriptive of each cats' personality, you really get to know them. Most are related too, she had a few generations of cats. You get to see how she came to having them, how they grew up and had kittens, how they acted, and who she kept. Each page has a large, beautiful and realistic illustration of the cat being focused on. There are funny parts, good for reading to a child, but it has an adult tone as well, so it's really a great book for any age. Meet My Cats: what a great way to honor your precious feline children, to write a whole book about them! The inside cover has their &#34;framed portraits&#34; and names, so you know who is who. My favorite cat was Muppet the dark tabby, because of her look and the story told about how Ms. Ivory had to get a new fridge just to keep Muppet out of their food! Then there was Amon-Ra, the Siamese who liked to talk alot and knock things over. And Agneatha, the graceful tri-colored Persian who was very sweet and loyal in demeanor. And so on. Overall a stellar book, great for your kids to grow up on and remember as a good childhood memory as adults. And this marketplace is the only one that has this book available.

A38CKJ7C1K71JF,0001842501,Kiwi,4,4,"Friday's Tunnel was written by John Verney (1913-1993), an artist, author and former member of the SAS/SBS in WW2 and published in 1959. The book is set in the 1950's and despite being written as a children's book, it brings back the political atmosphere of the 1950s, when the arms race between the two great superpowers, America and the USSR, dominated a world in which Britain, losing face over Suez, Cyprus and its African colonies, could not believe it had lost its power in the world. It's a charming and now rather dated book in which children say things like, ""You're in a proper pickle"", ""Gosh, what a spiv!"" and ""I think it's simply lousy!"". All the grown-ups smoke cigarettes and you can spot an Old Harrovian in the station car park because of his scarf. Similar in some ways to the ""world of yesteryear"" charms of Arthur Ransome's ""Swallows and Amazons"" series of childrens books.Similarly to Arthur Ransome' or bits and pieces of C.S Lewis' children's books  in other ways, the book depicts a world where upper-class, bohemian English children live in large, rambling houses, and can find clues in Virgil and Who's Who. And although it is very definitely a post-Suez novel, even the Left-wing characters do not exactly contradict the view of the lead ""evil"" character, that ""the British are the only race fit to wield absolute power"". Which of course, used to be correct (hey, I like Rudyard Kipling too...). Kind of makes you wonder what happened to the education system over the last fifty years doesn't it. How many schoolkids today have even heard of Virgil, much less read him?On to the book itself. The villain of Friday's Tunnel is a Tory (that's the British Conservative Party for you non-Brits) peer called Lord Sprockett. He was an MP, and during the war (WW2), he has made money out of many unscrupulous schemes. The narrator of the book, a 13-year-old girl, asks her liberal American mother why her Daddy, a Left-leaning journalist, so hates Lord Sprockett. She is told: ""Daddy disapproves of people who go on and on making money just for the sake of the power it gives them. He thinks rich men should create something with their wealth like Lord Nuffield; or buy pictures and build wonderful houses like the Lord Querbury he once wrote a book about."" In other words, Sprockett isn't really a gentleman. Indeed he isn't. The reader soon finds out that his grandmother was a domestic servant, and he descends from the gipsy-like folk who live in caravans on the Sussex Downs and who themselves descend from the brigands of a Mediterranean island called Capria.The &eacute;minence grise from the Ministry of Defence who comes to help sort out the central mystery of the story remains convinced that for all his villainy, ""Lord Sprockett"" is basically a Tory. First, ""in spite of fame and fortune and properties in Shropshire and Capria, and his yacht and his millions, he'd always longed some day to buy up the scene of those humiliating early struggles in the pantry"". Second, he isn't ""simply out to make an astronomic fortune\u2026 he believes passionately that the British are the only race fit to wield absolute power"".Spies discover that on the island of Capria there exists a substance called caprium, which makes the H-bomb seem mild. In order to get hold of it, the Americans start the rumour that there has been a dangerous coup on the island, which justifies their intervention. Gus Callender, the father of our narrator and the Lefty journalist (and former MP) who hates Lord Sprockett, is one of the few Englishmen who really knows the island. He writes an article to show that the Russians and Americans are escalating the crisis for their own ends. Meanwhile, someone - the wicked Lord Sprockett? - has been exporting the deadly explosive caprium and hiding it in empty packing-cases in a disused canal tunnel under the Sussex Downs.It's a marvelous, if somewhat dated, book for children. The charming illustrations are by the author  himself - he was an artist first and a writer second. As well as writing and illustrating his own books, he did drawings for the books of Gillian Avery and Anthony Buckeridge. During WW2, he was parachuted into Sardinia for the SAS (he was a member of the WW2 SAS's Special Boat Squadron) in 1943, and it was this experience which inspired both this story and his memoirs Going to the Wars (1955) and A Dinner of Herbs. He also wrote a number of other children's book. Sadly, Friday's Tunnel is probably too politically and socially incorrect to be reissued as a children's book today. However, it's very readable and a good read for all that. Probably a better read for kids than most of the ""children's"" books on the market today. For one thing, it assumes children are intelligent and have a good command of the English language, it's certainly not ""dumbed down"" like so many kids books are today.",5,"""A charming literary anachronism""",1214956800,"07 2, 2008"

The internet really has made 2nd-hand books easier to come by!'Knight after Knight was Sancha's debut novel, and was out of print for many years although I think there are some paperbacks from the 1990s floating around somewhere. The story concerns the feud between two noble families, with a rich array of characters, all of whom have delightfully punnish names: for instance, there is 'Sir Tiff Fide,' the slightly mad father-in-law of Spanish beauty B.U. Tiff Fide, and grandfather of young Myst Tiff Fide. Others include portly 'Sir Cum Ference,' lusty widow 'Lady Ida Dora Mann' and local priest 'Father Off.' These characters get into all kinds of wonderful scrapes, including kidnapping! pirates! dangerously fashionable shoes! duels! and of course a nice siege battle to finish off. As you can tell from the character names, this is a light-hearted romp, but one based on a fairly sound understanding of historical detail, including the design of fortifications, the building of siege weaponry, the practice of intercessory prayer, and medieval aristocratic fashions.Set off by Sancha's delightful pen-and-ink illustrations, 'Knight after Knight' is highly recommended to readers who like their young adult historical fiction with a touch of whimsy.If you are interested in medieval history/ humour for the early teen age group, you may also like Catherine Jinks's 'Pagan' series, starting withPagan's Crusadewhich is also available on Amazon.

A4FX5YCJA630V,0001845357,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""",0,0,"Last year I tracked downThe Messengerby Monica Dickens after recalling how much I enjoyed it in my middle-school years. Surprised to find it for sale on Amazon (despite being years out of print), I ordered it and was happy to discover that it was one of those rare books that are just as good in adulthood as they were when read as a child. So it was with excitement that I realized there were three sequels, beginning with this, ""Ballad of Favour.""During her lifetime, Monica Dickens (a direct descendant of Charles Dickens) was best known for writing standard ""horse stories"" for girls, but did something rather different with this four-book series, combining her love of horses with a supernatural time-slip adventure. Rose Wood is a thirteen year old girl who lives at Wood Briar Hotel, owned and managed by her mother. Situated near the ocean and the moorlands, Rose has plenty of room in which to grow, and enjoys helping out in the hotel, socializing with the guests as well as attending horse-riding lessons at the local stables. Though she has gets along well with her good-natured mother, she and her father have a slightly more strained relationship.Perhaps to make up for this, she shares a special friendship with one of the permanent residents of the hotel, an elderly man called Mr Vingo, who is privy to her deepest secret: that she is the chosen messenger of Favour, the spirit of a great grey horse that lived centuries ago. This horse is renowned in the area for its role in saving a village from a flood by escaping its cruel master and carrying a young stable-hand across the moors, outracing the impending waters in a bid to warn the people. Now considered a legend, the horse's spirit lives on, transcending the boundaries of time in order to send his chosen ones on quests to right wrongs and saves lives.Rose is one such chosen one, though she finds the calling as exhausting as it is rewarding. In the previous book, she was transported back in time in order to solve the mystery that surrounded the hotel's annex, a building haunted by tragic events and a cursed atmosphere that caused ongoing disasters throughout time. This first book was essentially a ghost story with a twist, requiring Rose to find out the root cause of the annex's affliction by inhabiting the minds and bodies of those who were there to witness key events, gathering information through their eyes despite being unable to intervene in any way.It was a fantastic story, one which stayed sharp in my memory ever since reading it, and so it almost seems inevitable that its sequel would fall a little short. In ""Ballad of Favour"", Rose is once more summoned by Favour, though this time it is not to right an old wrong, but prevent a future calamity from happening. Transported forward in time, Rose overhears the sound of a frightened child crying, and comes to realize that Favour expects her to find out where it's coming from, and to save it from whatever is frightening it. To do this, she's sent to several people and places in order to gather clues as to when and where the potential catastrophe is to take place.As a set-up, it's not quite as effective as that of the previous book, and the suspense that could have been generated by a race-against-time scenario in which Rose is struggling to make sense of her experiences before disaster hits is somewhat lessoned by the minutia that fills the story. A lot of it comes across as padding, whether it be Rose's involvement in her chores, with her friends, having riding lessons, or participating in a wedding. Whenever Favour calls to her, she has to take a lengthy trip across the moorlands filled with malevolent ghosts of the past, and one chapter is devoted to Rose seeing firsthand the life-saving gallop that Favour took over the moors to warn the villagers.But Monica Dickens has a great idea with which to work with. By giving Rose the ability to actually enter the minds of other people, we're privy to some intriguing insight into human nature and the secrecy of everyone's own internal thought processes. As it's put in the story: ""Rose was inside Linda. She could feel her emotions and what it was like to be her, but at the same time she was still Rose and could observe her."" In this case, Rose gets a taste of what it's like to be poor, or sick, or creative, or with low self-esteem, or a bully, or a different race. As a thoughtful and sensitive girl, this clearly has an effect on her, and she not only struggles with the responsibility that comes with being the Messenger, but the study that she must make of other people's internal thoughts and feelings.Dickens also has a way with words, such as: ""Rose and Abigail had to hold in their giggles until they could carry them out with their trays to the kitchen and dump their giggles on each other,"" or ""before them, the moor stretched away to the dark masses of the distant hills; above them, the dark side of the tower wall reached like a finger across the moon, next to it, the broken arch of what had once been a gateway; below them, a sheet of silver was the lake."" The story is filled with passages like these, making the whole thing vivid and lively. I found myself actively looking forward to seeing how Dickens would describe certain things and manage particular scenes.All in all, I enjoyed ""Ballad of Favour"", though not as much as its predecessor. Had I not read that one first, I may not have continued with this particular series, but having done so, I'm looking forward to the final two.",4,"""He Won't Finish With You As Long As You Do the Work Right - And in Secret...""",1366848000,"04 25, 2013"

One day at the very crowded state rural fair they literally bump into one another.  They are struck by the fact that they look just like one another: they could be doubles or even twins.  From this very first meeting the two boys feel drawn to one another and so they plan to meet again.  Greg actually does have a twin brother, Shane, but they are only fraternal twins: they do not look alike.  These two brothers are very close but, unlike Greg, Shane instantly hates Brian.  He fears that this new boy will somehow take his brother away from him.This story asks the question: 'What is a family?'  Is it blood relationship?  Is it the people you feel close to?  Is it just the people you spend most of your childhood with?  In this age of divorce the theme of divided families is most relevant, although the relationship fractures in this story are quite unusual.Lilith Norman develops her characters quite well in this novel.  Shane, who at first appears to be a stock bad-guy, in fact turns out to be quite a sympathetic character who the reader can understand and relate to.  This evolution of character makes the story interesting all the way through.  We feel we understand someone but then we learn more and this surprises us.Although the story is set in Australia it could really take place in any large city.  There are no special references to culture that make it hard for an international audience to understand it.  Although the book was first published in 1971 it has not really dated.  These days family biological relationship would be tested by DNA analysis rather than blood tests and other medical procedures, but other than that one detail nothing is parse.In all this is a very well written and original novel that would entertain many teenagers.

Bird ""Ramseelbird""",2,2,"As you may or may not know, &quot;The Stone Book&quot; is the first in a quartet of stories following a family throughout several generations. For my own part, I learned about the series through a hoity-toity British literary periodical entitled, &quot;Children's Literature In Education&quot;. The article I read mentioned that these were great lost classics and that anyone who knows ANYTHING about kiddie lit (as I like to call it) should be familiar with these books. The fact that this book won a coveted Phoenix Award years ago cemented the deal for me. The Phoenix Awards are given to children's books that, some believe, haven't gotten the attention they so richly deserve. So the real question becomes, is &quot;The Stone Book&quot; worthy of attention? Should children everywhere have to read it? And the answer is yes and no.This tale takes place in Victorian England and is all of sixty pages. Really, it's not much more than a short story in book form. In this tale, young Mary goes to a nearby church that her father is building. Her dad's a stonemason and is exceedingly good with rocks of all kinds. Mary cannot read, though her father can, and one night she asks him for a book as a present. In answer, he takes the girl with him to a cavern between the rocks. Leading her to a tight passage, he gives her strict instructions that she must follow. He tells her that once she reaches the end of the cavern she must come back and let him know if she still wants that book. Mary goes and discovers ancient cave paintings as well as footprints from hundreds of people before her. On returning to her father she is told that it has been a tradition in their family for the father to bring his eldest child (usually a son) down to that cavern and that it has been done for hundreds of generations. That night, Mary receives a book like no other and that, in a way, tells the tale of that day's adventures.There's a great deal going on in this tiny creation. Discussions about rocks come up frequently, often touching on the fossils and ancient (one might even venture, prehistoric) footprints that are found in the region. This leads, inevitably, to religion, the unspoken possibility of evolution, and the nature of literacy itself. One of the many debates in this book happens between Mary's father and her uncle Old William. Old William contends that books are a waste of time and only make people discontented with life. Mary's father is of the opinion that true wasted time is doing work every day and never showing anything for it. There's even a suggestion that Mary's father is discontented with his life, a fact that comes out when he gives in to the urge to drink once in a while.And all this happens in a scant sixty pages. Reading it, I found myself (for a long time) wondering if kids would like to read it. Seems to me that this book is a real contender for the books-adults-love-and-kids-ignore category of the library. Sure, there are deep rich meanings just waiting to be dug up throughout the text. Sure, this book tackles big subjects in a small clear way. But how many children are going to pick this puppy up voluntarily and enjoy it? Until Mary found herself alone in the deep dark cavern, I doubted that much of anything in this story would hold their interest. Perhaps that's why this book has been as forgotten as it is until now. If the kiddies don't dig it, what's the point?In short, &quot;The Stone Book&quot; succeeds and fails. It succeeds because it truly is a wonderfully written tale. It's a great look at daily life in a far distant time. It fails because I can't see many kids today successfully sinking their claws into the text. If you want something with a modicum of intelligence for yourself, enjoy. Just don't go handing it out to any five year olds you know.",4,At last!

The characters are very British in dress and demeanor, which can have an adverse affect on your enjoyment of the story. At times, the characters are stiff and a little too proper, which does at time seem quaint.Nevertheless, the 13 stories are still fun to read and ponder. Four of them feature Hercule Poirot, three star Miss Marple, two have the talents Harley Quin, two showcase personal consultant Mr. Parker Pyne, one utilizes the intellect of Tommy and Tuppence and a last one describes the demise of the great Inspector Evans.

The main character is an alien from another world, but few aliens are easier to identify with. He is seemingly perfect and wins the adoration of the villagers he meets but deep down is flawed and faulted. Adam o' the Cogs, the novels main child character, is also well drawn, being a welcome change from the standard 'cipher' characters of young adult fiction.

Fisher ""Ravenya""",0,0,"It is in an innovative world where England is divided into ninety-three floating isles, Queen Gloriana is celebrating over one hundred years on the throne, and all animals are mechanicals driven by a substance known as &quot;ichors&quot; that Robin Jarvis sets his latest book in a new series &quot;Intrigues of the Reflected Realm&quot;. Young Adam O' the Cogs lives a happy enough existence on Malmes-Wutton Estate, a young apprentice of the kindly Edwin Dritchley, and skilled in the mechanics of the robotic animals of the island. Along with his friends Henry Wattle and Jack Flye, Adam lives a simple enough life, until a number of unexpected guests arrive at the poor and isolated estate of Lord Richard Wutton.The first is the Queen's spymaster Walsingham and the astrologer Doctor Dee, who have come for reasons concerning the impending war between England and Catholic France/Spain. The second is an Iribian, who literally crash-lands on the estate (leading many to believe he is an angel) and who tastes the smells around him like we would sample food. But there is a secret hovering around this angelic visitor, and when he is summoned to London to see the Queen, Adam and Henry follow, unaware they are going to be forced into discovering just what it is...Robin Jarvis creates a fantastic world of historical figures (such as Robert Dudley and Francis Walsingham) and extraordinary surroundings, including glass-domed cities, collosal night barges, mechanical wonders and alien creatures. To this colourful backdrop is a story of political intrigue, strained friendships, dangerous conspiracies and uncovered secrets. With something happening on every page, both newcomers and fans of Robin Jarvis will not be disappointed with this offering.Perhaps there is a few flaws that should have been dwelt with - the historical background of the &quot;special ambassadors&quot;, as well as the geographical layout of England were rather confusing: without any real exposition explaining both subjects, I was often lost when the characters began talking about either topic. Likewise, the prolouge didn't really seem to mean much in the context of the rest of the stories, but I'm assuming it will come back into play in the rest of the planned future books.Furthermore, the continuing switching points of view from character to character got a bit mind-boggling: in one paragraph you can hear the inner voices of up to three characters. Why not just keep Adam as the narrator for simplicity's sake?But with his usual skill at creating interesting ideas and matching them with his beautiful and realistic illustrations, Robin Jarvis has written yet another ingrossing book.",3,&quot;The Treasure Beyond Rejoicing - The Breath of Innocence.&quot;,1073692800,"01 10, 2004"

There were 245 titles on Amazon's database at last count.This story of our blue bell bonneted buddy is Part 12 of the &quot;All Aboard for Toyland &quot; series. Some romance comes into young Nod's life in the form of Tessie Bear. They get quite seriously involved, particularly when they lose Farmer Straw's milk-churn and basket of eggs, which was tied to Noddy's new kite which lifted the milk and egg up into the sky, while Tessie tries to get the hens back into the hen-run after she left the gate open. Got all that?If they get caught, Noddy volunteers to take Tessie's share of the spanking. Tessie says &quot;You're so nice and I do like you so much&quot;.Enid was obviously such a high-flying authoress back in the 1950's she was apparently immune from the rigour of the editor's blue pencil.A bad blooper occurs in the continuity of the story between page 46 and 47. On page 46 we have &quot;..... the milk-churn wasn't up in the sky any longer. The string had broken and the churn had fallen down....&quot;. On the following page we have &quot;.... Tessie kept her eye on the swing milk-churn high up in the sky..... &quot;Noddy, Noddy - the churn's falling down, it's falling!&quot; Woops!You can't deny these stories are classics. The language and the sentiment in these tales is very Edwardian, that is, very stern and stilted. There is always a moral to the story, typically revolving around the virtues of charity.Fiona Cummings has rewritten this series of books in recent times, under the Enid Blyton trademark. They have been greatly abridged with the illustrations more cartoon like.Despite the quaintness, the unintended humour and sloppy editing, the originals by Dame Enid herself are the best choice.

AXUDXQFT83YO9,0001983806,"John Gough ""John Gough - Deakin University""",0,0,"Pookie's Crisis of Christmas BeliefIvy L. Wallace is a marvellous author-illustrator, leaving aside her other, now neglected, work as an author of full-length children's novels.Her ""Pookie"", and ""Pookie Puts the World Right"" are amongst the best picture-story books ever written.By comparison, ""Pookie Believes in Santa Claus"" is almost as good, but arguably not in the same top quality.What is it about?""Pookie Believes in Santa Claus"" tells another story of Pookie, the little rabbit who has been born, through some happy accident of magic, with wings, even though no other rabbits, in his own family, or elsewhere, can fly.Having been forced to leave his own home (in ""Pookie""), to seek his fortune, Pookie now lives with Belinda, the kind daughter of a wood-cutter.Pookie's woodland world is a gentle fantasy blend of Arthur Rackham-like elves and goblins in an almost idyllic forest world, among wood-folk such as rabbits, mice, squirrels, moles and owls -- think of Beatrix Potter's animals or Allison Uttley's wonderful ""Little Grey Rabbit"" picture-story books -- as well as elves, goblins, pixies and similar creatures of fairytale.In ""Pookie Believes in Santa Claus"", the story opens a few days before Christmas.Pookie is puzzled. He HEARS everyone talking about Santa Claus, and the wonderful presents Santa Claus brought in earlier years. But he SAW Belinda's father secretly putting Belinda's sturdy new shoes beside her bed on the previous Christmas Eve, and he KNOWS Belinda secretly made his own Christmas present of red trousers: and so on.When Pookie discusses this with his woodland friends, naturally no one has SEEN Santa Claus, and the best any of them can say is that they HOPE there is a real Santa Claus. But they all have DOUBTS.Then, on Christmas Eve, the woodland folk gather in the wood for the ""Great Thank You"". This involves an outdoor sharing and feasting of homemade Christmas-tide goodies, and then, at one minute to midnight, a collective lifting of happy faces to the star-filled sky, and a quietly smiled ""Thank you"", for the joy of living.(Clearly this is a variant of the legend retold in Thomas Hardy's Christmas poem, where at midnight on Christmas Eve all the animals kneel in adoration and memory of the birth of the Christ Child. Published in 1953, ""Pookie Believes in Santa Claus"" is about FOUR YEARS earlier than Dr Seuss's classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Uttley's ""Little Grey Rabbit's Christmas"" dates back to 1939! But, as I recall, Little Grey Rabbit and her companions have none of the mystical ceremony of Seuss or Wallace, only a rich version of country traditions and gift-giving.)When the other woodland folk go back to their homes, Pookie stays outside, determined to meet Santa Claus.And (PLOT SPOILER!) he does.But this is a disillusioned Santa Claus. He feels that no one believes in him. The good deeds of secret Christmas-time gift-giving, that his great-great-great-...-grandfather had started for poor people, are, this current Santa Claus feels, no longer needed. And NO ONE BELIEVES!Happily, Pookie certainly believes in what he has actually seen.In fact Santa Claus takes Pookie back to his own secret wood, where Pookie sees the goblins who make the secret Christmas presents and cook the Christmas toffeeJust as happily, Santa offers to take Pookie and twenty-six (why that number?) of his best friends back to his secret wood for a Christmas Night banquet.Happily, heartened by Pookie's faithfulness, Santa Claus resolves to continue.Just as happily, Santa Claus also has a young son who will keep the tradition.Early in the wee hours of Boxing Day, Pookie falls asleep, saying, ""There'll always be a Santa Claus!""That IS the right ending to this kind of what's-it-all-about book.For young children who are on the verge of starting to disbelieve in Santa Claus this is, indeed, ALMOST the perfect book.Why ""almost""?Unfortunately, Ivy Wallace has given a portrait of Santa Claus who does not quite fit the standard Santa Claus tradition that most children are raised to believe.Her Santa does not live at the North Pole, and does not have elves.Wallace's Santa Claus lives in a wood, or deep forest, and his helpers are goblins.He does, fortunately, wear the traditional (the tradition, apparently, established by Coca Cola advertising posters from the 1930s?) red suit with white fur trim.He does have a sleigh of reindeer that flies (or perhaps it only glides over the snow).But, CONTRARY to modern tradition, Wallace's Santa Claus gives presents, secretly, ONLY to children and others (adults, animals, fairy-folk) who were too poor, or too alone, to give to other people, or to receive presents themselves from other people.This helps Pookie realise WHY so few people now believe in Santa Claus: most people have enough money or other means, and enough social contacts to do all the Christmas giving and receiving without any need for a separate real secret Santa Claus. In fact, many dress up to pretend to be the ""real"" Santa Claus.Obviously, as Pookie now understands, this means that the remaining role for the real Santa Claus is to continue to fill the gaps of the poor and lonely.(But this is NOT what most very young children are told about Santa Claus, is it?)Santa explains:-- ""And when people and children open their presents on Christmas morning they KNOW who all their presents are from and thank each other, and then say, ""Look what Santa Claus brought me!' And the joke is I've never taken them anything yet, Pookie, because they all have plenty of friends and relations to give them presents!""(If only we could be confident that the poor and lonely DO get secret presents from the REAL Santa!)Happily, the TRUE meaning of Christmas is at least hinted at in this story.(Seuss's story of the Grinch offers no account at all of the birth of Jesus. For Seuss, probably understandably, as a liberal Jew writing for a mainstream Christian-minded audience, Christmas IS special, but it amounts to not much more than the specialness of a traditional family-and-community get-together like Thanksgiving.)While Wallace's Santa Claus describes his ""very kind"" ancestor, the original Saint Nicholas (with no mention of the religious meaning of the titular word ""saint""), this current Santa Claus says, mysteriously:-- ""... my [ancestor] ...when Christmas-time came around ... liked to see every one happy. It is too big a thing to explain to a small Rabbit, but Humans have the most wonderful reason in the world for remembering Christmas Day"".Pookie says that Belinda has told him about this, and mentions the woodland folk's ""Great Thank You"", and adds, ""It is almost too big and wonderful for small Animal's brains to understand, but we know we're alive in a beautiful World, and we feel we MUST say 'Thank You!'"".In short, ""Pookie Believes in Santa Claus"" comes close to providing a happy, plausible story that reinforces the might-be-doubting child's innocent belief in Santa Claus, or Father Christmas (""Same person!"", says this Santa Claus -- of course!), while nudging the child to remember the real story of the Nativity.(However what THAT itself -- the Nativity -- REALLY means is, indeed, almost ""too big a thing to explain"". Any explanation would need to resort to recounting the story of Adam and Eve's temptation and Fall, and the redemption of Christ's sacrifice at Calgary on Good Friday. And then we need to add in something about ""the Son of God"". Maybe Seuss is right to emphasise the mere sociable celebrating, and leave theology for older children and adult study. Maybe Raymond Brigg's grumpy old ""Father Christmas"" is at least as convincing an account of the ""REAL"" Santa Claus, with NO Christian trappings whatsoever, just a home at the North Pole, flying reindeer, and secret presents.)Not so happily, Wallace gives poorly chosen names to some of Santa's woodland helper-goblins: there is Mimp who makes doll's house tea sets on a miniature potter's wheel, Delp who paints the tea sets, and Gink who bakes them: and distressingly there is Plop, the plump cook who makes Christmas toffee. (For many young children ""plop"" is a rude word that euphemises dung).As with all the ""Pookie"" books the illustrations are full of delightful tiny detail of animals, their clothes and food and houses, and their woodland lives.(Needless to say, these are mainly mammals, and some species of birds, plus assorted creatures of magic fairyland fantasy. No predators. Even the owls seem not to prey on mice or other small animals: and there are no foxes, unless they are vegetarian. But this IS a children's book.)John Gough -- Deakin University -- jugh@deakin.edu.au",4,Pookie's Crisis of Christmas Belief,1320192000,"11 2, 2011"

The general consensus is that they're a nasty bunch, and author Yves Lavigne takes great pains to demonstrate why through many pages describing bomb attacks, arrests, and trials. Although this is his third book about the Hells Angels, it's the first one I've read. The focus here is on the Angels' battle with other gangs for domination and with the police.Lavigne's work is extremely detailed. Many names and dates are provided and by page 40, I'm thinking yeah, I get the picture: war, blood, death, arrests, media spins, police incompetence, and so on, yet the info continues for many more pages. His points about the Angels' ruthlessness and how the police botched opportunities to shut the Angels down before they became so strong is mentioned numerous times throughout the book. Newspaper articles and interviews are reprinted when short excerpts would have sufficed.When Lavigne included 50 pages of excerpts from minutes of Hells Angels meetings near the end of this 458 page book (broken up by a few photos), I groaned at first, but the minutes proved to be hilarious in places. Where else would you find board meetings granting permission for members to send greeting cards to other charters? Although nothing is ever mentioned about criminal activity in the minutes, there is a great deal mentioned about club rules.

It was difficult to read the survivors' accounts and realize how close the entire group came to death.I recommend this book for anyone interested in the outdoors, canoeing, and camping trips.

His parents talked to a doctor and he suggested that he be turned into a girl they named Brenda.Brenda was never a girl though and fought against having surgery to make her more female as well as the estrogen pills she was forced to take. Even though Brenda was more typically male than her identical brother the doctor forced the parents into trying to maintain a female identity, which was against what Brenda wanted. At the age of 14 Brenda was told the truth and lived from then on as David- eventually marrying and becoming the father of his wife's three children.All in all a fascinating story",5,What makes a person them??,1247616000,"07 15, 2009"
A1L43KWWR05PCS,0002000474,,6,6,"This is a wonderfully written book and a fascinating look into the debate of nature versus nurture in the area of gender assignment. Intelligent and insightful, the author draws a compassionate portrait of a family who, faced with a decision in the wake of a tragedy, relies upon the advice of a well-respected doctor, which reliance turned out to be misplaced. The book details the aftermath of the family's fateful decision and the impact it was to have on them all.In August 1965, Canadians Janet and Ron Reimer gave birth to identical twin boys, whom they named Brian and Bruce. When they were about eight months old, they arranged to have them circumcised due to a medical condition that caused them pain during urination. Circumcision was to remedy the problem. Little did they know that the circumcision for Bruce would be botched, resulting in the loss of his penis.A plastic surgeon with whom the Reimers had consulted in connection with the catastrophe that had struck Bruce had spoken to a sex researcher who had recommended that they raise Bruce as a girl. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic had suggested that they ought to get a second opinion with regards to that suggestion. The parents then consulted with a doctor affiliated with John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. John Money, a renowned doctor in the area of gender transformation, who had been the driving force behind the then controversial surgical gender re-assignment procedure for which the hospital was becoming known.In 1967, the distraught parents met with Dr. Money and shortly after, Bruce became Brenda and clinical castration followed. Thus, their child, who genetically and anatomically had been born a boy, was for all extent and purposes now deemed to be a girl. Brian was now on the other side of the gender divide of his identical twin brother, the twin formerly known as Bruce.Moreover, Dr. Money now had a dream scientific experiment, because he had a set of twins for which the unafflicted twin could act as a control by which to measure the afflicted one. In 1972, Dr. Money disclosed his ""twins case"" to the medical world, giving a slanted version of the experiment that made it appear to be an unqualified success. Unfortunately, his analysis of the situation did not disclose the difficulties that Brenda was having and her seeming inability to adjust to being a girl.Apparently, though Brenda had no idea as she was growing up that she had originally been born a boy, she never felt that she was a girl. Years of follow-up visits with Dr. Money for both twins proved to be unsettling for them, as Dr. Money employed somewhat bizarre methods and procedures. Moreover, as Brenda grew older, she would resist additional surgeries and initially resisted the hormone therapy that was introduced on the eve of puberty. Even when confronted with a totally rebellious Brenda, Dr. Money, however, remained in denial about the failure of his experiment. He would continue to tout his treatment of Brenda as an unqualified success.It was not until March of 1980 that Brenda was finally informed by her father about what had happened to her years ago and what had been decided in light of the circumstances. It was a revelation that was to dramatically change Brenda's life. What followed was a repudiation of Dr. Money's assertions with respect to his treatment. The book details the changes that Brenda was to make in her life, changes that would find her living the life she was originally meant to lead. Brenda would now become David and live the life of a male. Unfortunately, happiness would continue to elude him.This is a simply wonderful, intimate look at a family that survived a hideous tragedy. It also sympathetically and sensitively details the personal journey of one family through the labyrinthine differences in opinion surrounding the age old debate over nature versus nature. I would certainly assert that nature, and not nurture, controls. This is a very well thought out book on the issue, grounded in the tragic experience of one family.

I had to read this in one sitting-I was riveted. What made me especially angry to read is that the elders told Kim she had to return to her husband (the person who killed her and her children). The elders are partly to blame. And the treatment the author received at the funeral was shocking-being shunned and ignored and his name being omitted from the list of survivors. How dare anyone be so callous and unfeeling? And yet I remember as a small child to be told to behave that way when in the company of disfellowshipped people. I think the story is well-told and recommend it highly to anyone trying to open their eyes to this organization.

A3CMLN7FQQCNK1,0002000601,Witness for Jehovah &#34;Chris&#34;,2,10,"''The story seemingly is portrayed to blame the Jehovah's witnesses atleast in part for the tragic death of Kim and her two children (allWitnesses) and whilst it is written in transparency style it consistentlyportrays the events in a way which her former husband James wastreated poorly and shunned even at her memorial and which his (secondwife a non witness took offence) and in turn gave little understanding tothe procedures then that took place and missed the purpose of thememorial. The practises of the JW'S at this time was subject to thepolicy the controlling body called the ""governing body"" had put in placeat this time to in effect have no association with ex-witnesses (which Jimor James the first husband had now become) which unfortunately led tothe hostile retaliation displayed by her husband even reporting to newspapers which only serves to detract from the transparency he took somuch trouble to instill in the writing of the book.The author setting this aside for the most seems to have written achronological account starting with his childhood and life history until hismarriage and subsequent divorce and his resistance toward his childrenwith his former wife as to visitation rights and finally the effects of thechanged policy of Watchtower Organizational Enforcement that activeJehovah's Witnesses were instructed to ""not associate with formerwitnesses not even to talk with them or listen to them as they wereviewed as apostates"" not of the Bible but of ""God's Organization"".The above policy contributed to the problems experienced the author wroteabout in his separation and divorce and dealings after and at theKingdom Hall Memorial in relation to the deaths of his two children.What this demonstrated is that ""taken too far"" this policy ""caused unfairtreatment of those most affected"" and really was more about protectingthe ""Organization"" rather than protecting the people within it claimed.This above comment is based upon the revealed practises disclosing this inbook ""Crisis of Conscience"" which highlights the reasons why this policywas made law within Jehovah's witnesses, was to maintain control of all.It may therefore be contributory to better understand this response toJim the author in this book by first reading Raymond Franz's book whichcoincide's with the treatment ""Jim"" had been given him from the JWcommunity as the enforcement of the decision reached in ""governingbody"" to protect their own authority by enforcing disfellowshipping on allwhom contradict or question Watchtower Official Teaching coming fromthem and to squash any remnants remaining preventing all discussion. [Censorship]In addition it has always been that this ""governing body"" claims Divineauthority and claims being appointed as a part of what is referred to as""Discreet Slave"" class thus giving them this authority. Having anauthority they exercise such ""as they see fit"" by ""only them be allowed todirect what scriptural practises and allowances are permitted"" and bygiving instructions to their ""appointed elders"" via letters andWatchtowers etc. what may become ""policy in this case as to marriage.""The marriage of ""Kim to James or Jim (the author) produced the twochildren the subject of the tragedy and adverse comments elsewhere.To better understand this tragedy one needs to understand backgroundpolicy and what implications that may have had on negative writingswhich in turn may bring out negative comments in reviews or minds ofreaders. Only by explaining these procedures may in part some of whatmay be negative be put in proper perspective and whether the author inhighlighting these may have failed to give equal attention to his own roleand whether this may equally contributed in some degree? Whether thetragedy may well have been avoided in the event (the author) took amore scriptural view of marriage given he claimed he was also a JW?His candid account relates his early adult life just prior to meeting hiseventual  wife ""Kim"" the victim. Jim writes of his own preoccupation withparticularly younger women or girls and some of these not being JW'Sbut what may be referred as ""worldly"". Jim relates without regret his""sexual intimacy"" with a number of these even at a time when he claimshe was a Jehovah's witness which is a disfellowshipping offence. This ismentioned because it gives a weakness in the author's own characterand hence whilst he held this weakness other implications may follow?Simply put setting this aside ""when he married Kim"" he ""took a vow toGod"" and as a Christian to obey Christ's and apostle Paul's commandson marriage. Therefore when he ""separated from Kim"" not on groundsfor Divorce that being ""adultery"", he went back to his own `sexualweakness' and got involved with worldly women and committed adulterythus giving ""Kim"" the grounds for Divorce and re-marriage.The story relates how ""Kim"" is portrayed as walking a fine line in useing the ""elders"" to for want of better words manage her husband and her marriage the way she wanted, reducing again sexual compassion the thing ""Jim"" seemingly complains about was lacking and which her second husband seemingly also had issue with, which may be a contributory factor, given the accuracy that these portions may not be distorted in some way.Whilst the circumstances led to tragedy within the Jehovah's witnessescommunity with her second husband also a Witness, all this may havebeen avoided in the event the author took the lead and maintainedintegrity within his marriage to ""Kim"" even if separated from her. ""Jim""admits within his reasons why he felt ""Kim"" sought a ""Divorce"" ongrounds of adultery that the Jehovah's witnesses religion would onlyallow her to get re-married if she could obtain such. This does not mean""Jim"" had to comply as this is merely an excuse to justify his nothonouring marriage.On the other hand this does not give ""Kim"" an excuse either. Even ifadultery was proven she did not have to get re-married and exposing awrong attitude by both given they were both witnesses. ""Incomparability""was sighted really as the grounds of separation although this also doesnot give grounds for the actions taken thereafter. One only needs toread the Bible book of ""Hosea"" to see that even if ones partner isunfaithful if a person puts God first they can remain faithful even to theirunfaithful mate and hence the second marriage would not be an issue.In this event neither would the tragedy of children the real victims, asthey wanted their father and mother to be parents therefore both of themand if both parents put this first none of this may have occurred. Hencein contrast the value of story is answering the question could it havebeen avoided. The answer may well be ""Yes with difficulty."" [Remove me -ism]In fairness to criticism of the religion and elders by some. This sort ofthing can happen in other religions and more so in secular societywhereby the things referred to in regard to marriage or lack of it, arefreely practised and jealousy between relationships is common place.As for the Elders criticised for sending ""Kim"" back to the ""Killer"" may beunfair in as much as ""Kim"" also used the elders according to book forher own purposes and they could only act upon how the information waspresented to them and they too had limitations. They did turn in the""killers first gun"" after they were advised he had a gun and confrontedhim seeking an explanation. When he did not satisfy their concerns theygave the gun to the authorities. They were unaware of a second gunwhich he purchased soon after. They also ""Disfellowshipped"" him beforehis trial after questioning him. They carried out as above ""Watchtowerpolicy"" toward the author. Setting aside this wrongness; they did whatthey were directed to do and acted within those limitations.The above in ""no way"" endorses the policy the Watchtower enforcedhowever given the error's the Elders acted in a way they were able notknowing that the second husband was going to turn into a 1st degreemurder, not even ""Kim"" the victim was aware of this right up until thetragedy. The real tragedy is that it may have been avoided, this in ""noway condones the actions taken by the killer"".The most positive aspect of the book was the response of the author James Penton of a book called Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses  whereby he gave ""James or Jim Kostelniuk"" and his second wife [a non witness] a ""heart felt response"" of recognition in relation to the death of his children something the father of victims ""desperately needed which had been lacking"". [See pages 119-121]. James Penton is an ""authority on Jehovah's Witnesses"",[1914 date] himself victim of the policy of disfellowshipping not on scriptural grounds but for questioning Official Organizational Teaching whether Scriptural led to his removal which underlies this story and book [that censorship is to prevent questions being answered] and was able to understand the effects on peoples best.Whilst the book was rivetting it ""failed to remain unbiassed in certainareas toward witnesses"", whilst at the same time giving a historic recordof the increased difficulties that the change in policy in the early 1980'sby the ""governing body"" which instilled a ""loveless community betweenformer brothers"" which gives a rivetted account on peoples lives affectedand ultimately contributed to the authors difficulty in exercising hisparental role to protect his own children from the enforced actions ofelders as he perceives or in having contact with his own children inwhich he may have been able to in some way intervene to protect themin the event he suspected violence, which he claims he did, but waswithdrawn contact. This being the case, lessons may be learnedkeeping these principles of the effects of misapplied motives in restraintwhen children are involved, the responsibility on parents only increases,this is the real tragedy that both parents ""put themselves first, not thechildren"". In the event they remained married the children may be alive,emphasising the importance of remaining loyal to their marriage vows.In event when reading book one keeps these principles in mind it maybe beneficial in seeing that this may be a lesson in importance ofremaining loyal to ones ""first mate even if they appear incompatible""especially when children are involved; follow the golden rule ""put theother first not yourself"" hence Divorce is not an option hence children atleast whilst growing up have both natural parents and their safety a key.It becomes a further tragedy if in reading this book, may not learn fromthe obvious, as outlined above, that both parents failed the loyalty test.",3,An Avoidable Tragedy Given Parents Were Jehovah's Witnesses,1252195200,"09 6, 2009"

First of all, a bio of Marcel Dionne is a terrific idea as he's a player, maybe because he was based in the hockey backwater of El Lay, most fans really overlooked for much of his career. The book gives you an unbelievable appreciation for a truly great player and and even better individual.The stuff on his junior days and the whole push-me-pull-me battle of a top Quebec prospect playing his major junior hockey in the OHA was eye opening. It's also interesting to note Marcel was truly the first free agent (albeit under different circumstances) that resulted in him leaving Detroit for LA.The insight on '72 Team Canada's turnaround in Russia may have been due to player's wives and girlfriends being allowed to join the players. That is certainly the first time I've heard that and it makes a lot of sense given the &quot;us vs. them&quot; bunker mentality Team Canada developed.So much in this book is fresh and makes me wonder what were journalists reporting on back then because they missed a terrific subject in Marcel. It's also mind boggling how Lafleur and he were connected right to the end with the NYR shoving  a still productive 30-goal scorer in Dionne aside to bring back Lafleur from retirement. (for the record Guy got all of 18 goals in his comeback).This book certainly gives Marcel his due and might I suggest Ted pick maybe Gilbert Perreault or Stan Mikita as his next hockey players to give the bio treatment to.",5,"give up teaching, Ted, and write more hockey bios!",1124409600,"08 19, 2005"

Barbara McLintock chronicles the history of the Montreux Clinic from the point when its founder, Peggy Claude-Pierre, started helping her own daughters deal with their eating problems to the point when the clinic surrendered its license. The author never makes her topic too over-emotional or turns it into a clinical case. She clearly explains the struggles that sufferers of anorexia and their families went through before and during their stay at the Montreaux clinic. You feel a great deal of sympathy for the patients and their families. It would have been easy for McLintock to paint Peggy Claude-Pierre as a villian. However, McLintock remains objective and honest with her entire subject matter and isn't afraid of including views of people who support the clinic's actions.

I had access to everything and everyone there during my visits.  I was never denied access to records, clients, etc.The author creates sensationalism which their business thrives on.  Peggy Claude Pierre did help many, and hopefully, still is.  I note that the author dwells on the few that didn't suceed in the program rather than the large number that did.  I had a patient that went there and as testament, I continue to receive cards from the parents yearly from the family for being a part of saving their daughters life (who when I accepted the case was being sent home from a large medical facility to let her rest comfortably while she was dying).Peggy may not be conventional but anyone who has seen her with an infant crying...or a client crying can tell she has the touch.  She truly cares about people and the work she is doing.And....why don't we attack her and David for making some money.  Let's see now...has the author gained from this book.  If not personal monetary gain, has she gotten her name ""out there"" on a sensational book?  People aren't allowed to make money.  None of the attackers made money?  When I frist met Peggy and David they were struggling.  I don't know their financial condition now, nor do I need to know.  They need to make a living like everyone else, so we condemn then becuase they have to worry where the money was going to come from?  Wake up!!  Go to ANY hospital in the United States with no insurance card, with a major catastrophic illness needing surgery and see if you get the services wtihout a way of granting payment.  See if the hospital or health care organization doesn't ask you for the deed to your home.  Get real!  This is the way it works.  There are bills to pay.  I work for a major health organization and I ""KNOW"" how the system works.  Let's compare their salaries to those of large hospital CEO's and see if we can find the differences in the millions in yearly compensation.Further...it's so very sad when people can't have hugs or some sort of compassion.

As he prospers in the drug trade he hooks up with some guys that lead him to a motorcycle club called the rock machine they being one of the gangs in montrealIt seems kind of ironic that they are called a motorcyle club because for most of the book he explains that being a member of the Rock Machine did not mean that you even had to have a harley as in most motorcycle gangs, also unlike most that are also leather clad the rock machine members had sweaters with their colors and insignia.The goes from a hangaround to full patch to the point that was really running alot of the gang activity in montreal. It covers alot of the war that was and is going on between the Hells Angels and their associates and the Rock Machine and their associates over the drug trade.

The language is beautiful on its own- I encourage people to read just the first paragraph of the book for the beauty of its language. It is a knockout of a first paragraph- always a good sign!This novel also succeeds on two other levels- creating characters that I really cared about, especially the two younger ones, Irene and David;and bringing big sweeping themes into the novel with astonishing success.Themes of: mental illness,Toronto's history, The Great Depression in Canada, anti-semitism, and the timeless tragedy of poverty and how it wittles away a person's self-esteem.These characters are fully drawn, and I could not turn the pages fast enough to find out how things turn out for them, like they were my friends or my neighbours. Amidst the pathos, a great love story is evolving.The ultimate power of this book is its ability to tell the story of depressive mental illness in such a way that it is sympathetic to both the mother trapped in the darkness of it, and the daughter who suffers from having such a weak and self-consumed mother. Usually only one of these points of view is captured. It took my breath away that this novel is sensitive enough to know that the mother's suffering is worse than the daughter's, even though on the surface the mother appears narcissistic and cruel.Lauren Davis takes us past surfaces and into the guts of these characters and this great story.I have recommended this book to my mother, who was born into Canada's Great Depression.

A30L6DGAVVAUB0,0002005050,,1,1,"This is a book about love in its most brutal incarnation - unrequited, or at best, partially or intermittently so. All that unrequited love is bound to make a girl needy. And needy she is, at one point describing herself as a ""clinging, terrified despot."" For all this, though, Louise is neither annoying nor cloying. Gowdy's portrayal is sympathetic and moving. The psychological underpinnings of Louise's hunger are entirely intelligible, and we cringe in empathy as she fails to read the signs, feeds her obsession and walks straight into traps of her own making. As a teenager, for instance, Louise makes a fantasy-fuelled trek to Vancouver to find Abel after he and his family have moved west, a journey we know can only end in humiliation and disappointment.We are thrown into a story that moves back and forward in time to reveal itself. The structure of the book creates occasional confusion, because shifts in time are not indicated by tense - we are caught in a disorienting perpetual present. As much as this is a criticism, though, it does effectively evoke the sense of suspension that occurs when one's love endures unrequited.It's a masterful accomplishment to be able to convey the absence of something rather than its presence, as is the ability to explore heartache while skillfully avoiding melodrama. Gowdy accomplishes this through humour, but more profoundly by touching a nerve, the one that knows we've all been there, wanting, in one way or another.",5,Unremarkable and Brilliant,1048118400,"03 20, 2003"

Restrictions are few - the implausible becomes commonplace, characters achieve extraordinary capacities, and plots may be as convoluted as the author's talent allows. The mundane is invoked only as a form of contrast to inventiveness. Bowering's story of a disenchanted teen-ager seeking her father in a far land isn't new, but her handling of how the narrative unfolds exhibits a poet's novel approach. It's a challenging read for a wide spectrum of readers.Cathreen seems destined to be drawn into difficult circumstances. She is caught up in the strange disappearance of a school mate. Children, especially teen-agers, can exhibit an inexplicable level of cruelty. Their world, often hidden from parents, can be terrfying. Cathreen's desire to be reunited with her father leads her from one horror to another as she tries to resolve her needs with his. She becomes embroiled in a bizarre community of recluses. Nick, the community's founder, is a ""back to the land"" advocate. He attracts a string of characters, including a revived ""bog man"". Galt becomes an agent of aggressive loyalties - with fatal results. Cathreen must navigate through this collection of misfits in her drive to join Jag, her father.Bowering caps her previous stories of mixed fantasy and reality with this tale. As a poet, Bowering brings a different tone to her stories. She's able to mix two genres seamlessly, never allowing fantasy to overcome real-life attitudes and events. If you are a devotee of ""fantasy realism"", you will find this a captivating tale. Bowering weaves a vivid tale as filled with human values. Her use of fantasy adds a touch of excitement to her sense of reality. She artfully conveys Cathreen's conern for her father along with her youthful adaptability.

A2YEGUTYW99SB5,0002005271,,1,1,"Up until the ending, I would have given this book 5 stars.  But I hated the ending.  I still think the book is worth reading, though.  The rest of it was great.The title first made me think of The Wars of the Roses, but the book isn't about that.  It is set in the Victorian Era, and it compares and contrasts the lives of two very different women whose lives unexpectedly become entwined, and who develop an even more unexpected friendship.  The ""Crimson Petal"" refers to the one who is a prostitute, while the ""White Petal"" refers to a respectable wife who is so pure, innocent, and naive as to be childlike - and who is also mentally unstable.I enjoyed the book so much that the length was never any problem.  The plot is unusual and interesting.  The reader can see what is probably coming down the road for Sugar, but in spite of all her experience, she hopes for the best and so do we.  (And you might think you know what's going to happen, but there is a very surprising twist.)  The characters are realistically flawed, but the women are nevertheless likeable.  And perhaps the best thing about this book is the way it evokes the Victorian time period with such detail and clarity, including the lifestyles of the poor and the social outcasts.  Here there is no stereotype of ""the prostitute with the heart of gold.""  Instead, we get a vision of a time during which a woman who has the looks to be a successful prostitute feels nothing but enormous gratitude that she needn't endure the backbreaking labor and poverty of a maid or factory girl.  We see the desperation that lies behind Sugar's efforts to always please her man.  And we also see the price exacted by the rigid Victorian beliefs and the highly restricted lifestyle of a respectable wife such as Agness.But the ending blows everything that The Crimson Petal and the White has built up for the reader.  In fact, there actually isn't any ending.  The book just stops in its tracks.  I'm not one to complain about books that have alternate endings, or which don't spell out the ending clearly but instead just give hints and then leave the reader to decide what happened.  Those aren't my favorite type of endings, but I do appreciate their creativity and their challenge to make the reader think.  But this book isn't like that.  It just plain stops, and you have no idea whatsoever about what might have happened.  It's like the author just suddenly got tired of writing, or maybe he reached the page limit set by his publisher.  That drove me crazy.  Yes, I know that's how real life works, and often we never know what really happened.  But that's why we read fiction!  So we can know all the answers, or at least have some kind of closure that makes sense.I discovered (by reading another review) that Faber did write a sort-of sequel.  It isn't a true sequel, and has a different format (short stories), but at least we do find out what became of the main characters from The Crimson Petal and The White.  It's called The Apple:  New Crimson Petal Stories, and yes, I do want to read it as soon as possible to find out the answers.Do you think that Faber did that deliberately to force us to buy a second book?  If so, I consider that cheating.  Even in an actual series (which these are not), I feel strongly that if a book is going to be published independently as a separate volume, then it should be able to stand alone.  I make exceptions only for books like The Lord of The Rings or The Jewel In the Crown, which are actually single books that had to be split up because they are too long to be published in one volume, and which are clearly labeled and sold as such.  So that if we buy one volume individually, we know exactly what we are getting:  only part of the story.Otherwise, this is an excellent book.(838 pages)",4,"I would have given it 5 stars, until the ending",1272758400,"05 2, 2010"

Yet the dialogue and motivations behind each personality are so spot-on and true to human nature that it's impossible not to care about, wonder about, or even fear (in some cases) the characters -- and that includes the rhinoceros leader -- whose thoughts and intentions are painfully human, thanks to Ness's vivid insights. The alternate world we're presented is also not that difficult to imagine; there is no technology beyond our grasp, and no religious belief that isn't mirrored by anything in our existence. It's a glimpse into a world that could be ours, and at people who could be us. I highly recommend it.",5,Inventive and involving.,1372723200,"07 2, 2013"
ACUWWG7JZN9U9,0002005298,The Peruvian Wunderkind,17,17,"Having never heard of either the title or the author, I nevertheless purchased the book as the absurd premise rather intrigued me: a fictional modern mega-city called Hennington that is normal in seemingly all respects but for its peaceful co-existence with a large herd of rhinos (technically called a crash). Reinforcing the fictionality of the environment, Ness introduces new words for established concepts e.g. ""Forum"" replaces heroin, ""Rumour"" replaces religion.The book deftly weaves in and out of a dizzying number of storylines involving Hennington's colourful characters: a millionaire octogenarian, a powerful golf course owner, a still-lactating 40-year old plus accountant/prostitute, a well-endowed gay waiter, an attractive out-of-towner with nefarious plans, etc. etc. Each chapter dedicates itself to one of these plots and rotates to the others accordingly. As many of the chapters are only 4-5 pages long, the reader is constantly juggling the various plots and puzzling together what went before and how the various story pieces fit together. The narrator function is liberally spread among characters, human and non-human alike, as well as an external narrator; oftentimes, the shift in textual orientation occurs in the same sentence.The multiple plots gradually coalesce into a sole narrative, and we see how the seemingly unrelated actions of one person nevertheless affect another (much like the vaunted `butterfly theory,' where the flapping of a butterfly's wings in one part of the world lead to tiny atmospheric changes that can eventually cause a tornado somewhere else). As the title suggests, the fate of the city is inexorably intertwined with the fate of the rhinos. The rhinos serve a sub-plot function, and like many of Shakespeare's plays, anticipate and suggest important developments in the main story lines. The rhinos are actually quite interesting; Ness obviously took the time to understand their social organization, individual traits, and feeding habits and makes their actions in a sprawling metropolis as believable as can be. The reader is usually privy to the mind(?) of the herd's leader; a compassionate middle-aged female whose over-arching concern is the welfare of the crash. Her frequent deliberations with notions of leadership, responsibility, self-sacrifice, and hope are very similar to the psychological entanglements the human characters must face.Howlingly funny in places, unspeakably tragic at others, but always entertaining, this was one book I had great difficulty putting down. The book is all the more impressive as this is Ness' debut novel.

Grania is a young girl who loses her hearing at the age of five. Her guilt-ridden mother refuses to accept that she is deaf and resists adapting to reality; only Grania's loving grandmother saves her from a life of illiteracy and loneliness. Grania is taught to read with &quot;The Sunday Book,&quot; a precious gift from her grandmother that becomes a metaphor for life's struggles and complications as Grania emerges from childhood, attends school, and meets &quot;Chim,&quot; a hearing man who loves her stillness. Just married, Grania must return home to wait while Jim goes to war as a stretcher bearer.Once again, WWI emerges as incredibly pointless and bloody, as men are thrown into the confusion of the European front. Jim experiences the war as a haze of brutal sound. He steels himself to the sight of mutilated men blown apart, but cannot stand the sight of their hands, which of course for him had become the instruments of his personal &quot;language of love&quot; with Grania. Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania's childhood who became her sister's husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine. Drawing on the foundation of love from her grandmother, the deaf Grania not only coaches him back to speech but heals her sister as well.

My enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact I grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three.  Here is why:Part one is about a child named Grania growing up in Canada in the late 1800's.  A bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf.  Thankfully, Grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read.  I know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is.  Grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words.  Readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times.  When she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts.  The teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure Grania understands what is going on.  The children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her.  Most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb.  When Grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world.  It is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.Part two is about an adult Grania who falls in love with a hearing man named Jim.  Jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest.  I found his conversations with Grania dull and their romance a bit sappy.  My mind began to wander.Part three follows Jim as he enters World War One and the fighting he experiences or sees.  This created a problem for me, as I said earlier, Jim just didn't hold my interest.Part one seemed a novel all of its own.  The style changed after that.

A319KYEIAZ3SON,0002005395,Mary Whipple,8,9,"In this sensitive portrayal of love and war, author Itani reveals the life of Grania O'Neill from her earliest days in Deseronto, Canada, through her marriage to Jim Lloyd, who serves in the Ambulance Corps during World War I.  Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap.  Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using.  When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex.  By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium.  Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share.  In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming:  pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers.  As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes.  The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends.  Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying.  As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader.  Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot;  Mary Whipple",4,Graceful and original treatment of man's oldest themes.,1064361600,"09 24, 2003"

As we try to inhabit the life and mind of Grania, deaf since the age of five from scarlet fever, we imagine what it would be like not to know when someone is approaching from behind, or to know when the speaker has changed in a conversation.  This book was just too slow-paced for me and the characters too one-dimensional.  Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault.  More complex is Grania's sister Tress, who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional.  Another interesting character is their mother, who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible, while she battles her guilt over Grania's hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests.  However, the author doesn't fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother, and we are left with a love story between two very nice people.  Jim's story is more disturbing than Grania's, actually, as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis.  His sections of the book are very moving reminders that the lives lost in wars are not just statistics.

It was a gift, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it's turned into a real winner.Spanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI, we follow the life of Grania, a child/woman who became deaf following scarlet fever. From a loving middle-class family, she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children, grew into a self-sufficient young woman, became a nurse, and married a hearing man, Jim. He went off to war, as did her childhood friend and brother-in-law, Kenan.

A8IPQ1Q1O7YX5,0002005395,"Roger Brunyate ""reader/writer/musician""",3,4,"Canadian author Frances Itani had a promising idea to write about the education and early life of a girl struck deaf in infancy, as her own grandmother was at the turn of the last century. And it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in World War I. The novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.Grania O'Neill -- the name is an anglicization of the Irish for ""love"" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. She wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. She has an ally in her grandmother Mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. But I found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into Grania's world. I was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.As a young adult, Grania falls in love and marries. But it is 1915, and her husband Jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. The unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as Sebastian Faulks'BIRDSONG. And the scenes back in Canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. But the fact remains that there is an ocean between Grania and Jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. Still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and Grania teaches him once more to talk.This is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence. It calls for an almost abstract style that can handle ideas and sensations rather than events -- poetry rather than prose.

AJDYDG7YZY9QL,0002005395,Stephen A. Haines,8,8,"The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else.  Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the ""abnormal"".  The young, autistic Christopher in ""Curious Incident"" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?Grania, who would have been ""Grainne"" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania ""blend in"" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a ""Deaf School"".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",4,The darkness of deafness,1100649600,"11 17, 2004"
A34LMAA7JOBJSZ,0002005425,,11,15,"This is a startlingly beautiful novel, even better than the author's previous work, The Bitter Taste of Time.  The present work is a love story of innocence and purity battling family and societal traditions, written with the plot structure and emotional denouement of an opera.  The setting is the Latin lushness of both the Old World and the New, Seville and the Yucatan, described in living prose suffused with azafran and agave.  It is a tale of aesthetes written by an aesthete.  The real genius in the writing is how so many threads of art, science, and history, including opera, ornithology, cartography, revolution, and even astronomy, are woven together into such a compact but rich backdrop which serves to enhance the beauty of the central love story.  The only thing wrong with this book, indicated by the title of this review, is that it's not published in the United States.  I got my copy during a recent stay in Toronto.

Fourteen years later, as Evie faces a turning point in her life in her adult life, she flashbacks to the days of ""innocence"" that lead her to where she is today.When she is on the mark, Kathleen Tessaro writes prose you want to roll your tongue around and savour like fine wine.  It is dense, delectable and begging to be spoken aloud - ""In summer, the fig tree drops its heavy fruit to form a thick, gooey compote on the pavement below...""  Her gift is for descriptions that draw you in, setting the mood for her characters, ""It's like a house in a Victorian play; overflowing with life, busy with knowledge and experience.  Even the dogs lolling about on the oriental carpet are engaged in battles of good versus evil.""I thoroughly enjoyed her debut novel Elegance, but in my mind her sophomore effort, Innocence, is the more fulfilling read.  This is most likely due to Evie who, from her impassioned defence of love at eighteen to her contemplation of her co-worker (""Each week, I marvel in fascination at the fragments of R.

A3RPWUX41CMFTD,0002005573,,16,17,"Several times I thought about giving up on Bedlam by Greg Hollingshead (on page 58, on page 176 and so on). What keep me reading was that I wondered whether I would have escaped being thrown in a mad house if I had lived in London at the turn of the nineteenth century, as had Jamie Matthews.I see now that it was the enigmatic and slightly confusing tale of Jamie's possibly wrongful confinement of over 20 years in Bethlem Hospital for the insane that kept me reading. If I could have come to the conclusion that he was insane and that this story was simply a dreary tale of his mistreatment, I perhaps would have put the book down. If I could have surmised that he was in fact confined because he came up on the wrong side of a political situation, I also perhaps would have put the book down. What kept me reading was the fact that I couldn't make up my mind even to the very end.The true genius of Hollingshead's book lies in the depth and complexity of the two main characters, Jamie Matthews and the John Haslam (Bethlem's apothecary), drawing you from one side to the other. Sometimes Jamie's ravings have just enough sense to make you believe his sanity, then something about them pushes it just past normal and you can see why he is committed. Likewise, John Haslam's treatment of the patients at Bethlem seems as times a life of dedication to serving the unfortunate in the best way he knows how, and at others times it is a self-serving project to further his own notoriety. In both cases, for both characters the answer is that it is all true. Rarely has there been such a wonderful portrayal of contradictions of the human condition.On page 436, the words of Jamie's devote wife Margaret sum up this portrayal of mental illness with a truth that persists to this day:""Perhaps in an imperfect world you don't find intelligence at its keenest pitch without some touch of [madness]. Perhaps there needs a certain pressure, heating the thoughts until they glow, and glowing ignite yours and by that sympathy show you more than you could ever see on your own, but then the brilliance grows too hot, fever sets in, and all common sense is lost, and that connexion is betrayed.""I would recommend this book to everyone, only don't complain to me as you slog through it.

Davis's thought-provoking novel. Orwell, having lived among the downtrodden, intimately portrayed poverty, misery and despondency in the first decades of the twentieth century. Davis sets her story against the backdrop of a contemporary version of Paris' underbelly. Far away from the tourist sites and the city's glamour, her characters are refugees, immigrants and survivors of violence and war, seeking forgetting, physical and emotional healing or redemption in the anonymity of the ""radiant city"".The novel centres around war correspondent Matthew Bowles, who, having witnessed most of the world's recent wars and civil conflicts, is struggling with accumulative post-traumatic stress.  He is ""hiding"" in a tiny attic flat in the 8th arrondissement, attempting to write his memoirs, courtesy of a solid book advance. Sometimes, images of recent trauma are so immediate and overpowering that he has to escape into drink and the haze of sleeping pills. He runs into a former colleague, Jack Saddler, Vietnam vet, ex mercenary and now photographer, who has his own demons to fight.  The shady bar scene, the dark corners and alleyways of the city's immigrant quarters bring as much temptation as danger to body and soul of the vulnerable. Matthew is drifting into a downward spiral of mental fog and easy violence.  Will he be able to save himself?A kind of counterbalance to these ""walking wounded"" is Saida Ferhat, who runs the Lebanese cafe across the square from Matthew's place.  She exudes calm and competence on the outside, yet under the surface she also has to struggle with her own traumas and memories.  Increasingly, she is also deeply worried about her sixteen-year old, impressible son Joseph.  She hopes and prays that Matthew and his friends can influence the boy away from the gangs and dangers in the neighbourhood...Davis's novel depicts a colourful cast of characters: each is trying to deal with life and the obstacles, real or imagined, that stand in the way.  She astutely captures the vulnerabilities and the dramatically and constantly changing moods of her primary protagonists. In small doses, the back story to each of them comes to light, allowing for a fuller understanding of their current conditions.  Her straight forward and precise descriptions and her detached tone, even when recounting highly disturbing incidents, create, in this reader's view at least, a sense of distance and detachment from the characters.  We can observe without much engagement. Matthew and to a lesser degree Saida, are the only characters allowing the reader some insights into their inner self, their emotional turmoil and struggle to cope and to attempt recovery.Paris is an exciting and vividly evoked setting, the author's intimate knowledge of the city is evident.  Having lived in Paris for some ten years, she leads the way through back streets and alleyways just as confidently as she depicts the steamy and lewd nightlife in the Bois de Boulogne.  At times, however, the elaborate details are in danger of moving the reader away from the essence of the story. [Friederike Knabe]",4,Down and Out in Paris,1278806400,"07 11, 2010"

The title refers to Paris, or to Paris for starters, & that might be the first element that engages us.  Lauren Davis provides an in-the-round guide to the ""the city of light"" -- one savvy enough, as well, to puncture that clich&eacute;.  Instead, RADIANT CITY offers the sort of roaring, oleant, mouth-watering & historically informed urban embodiment that only the most alert creative minds can provide.  Her Paris includes a lot that's off the beaten tourist path.  Intense scenes take place in the woods of the city's periphery (woods that startle us with a wide variety of sexual opportunities) & in a former industrial building converted to a skin-of-the-teeth commune & rave space.  But those exotic settings, in the sort of combinatory effect that distinguishes a terrific novel, also bring to light crucial conflicts & turning points in the central figures.  Chief among these is the traumatized war correspondent Matthew Bowles.  Not for nothing does Matthew share a name with Paul Bowles, the white outsider who achieved such sympathy for the oppressed of French North Africa.  Matthew too identifies with the abused & betrayed, too much for his own good, really.  He's Paris to lick his wounds, ideally by writing about them, pulling together a memoir about the horrible things he's seen.  Those horrors raise a bit of narrative problem, in that Matthew seems to have suffered too much to sustain what depth & self-knowledge he does; he verges just slightly on the superman.  But just slightly, no more, & certainly the scorching excerpts from Matthew's work in progress provide Davis with a counterpoint to this fortunate city in which he's now come to rest.  So do the photos & recollections of his scary friend Jack, a former mercenary w/ terrible secrets out of Vietnam & elsewhere, & so do the refugee Lebanese, the Ferhat family, still haunted by the beloved folks who never made it out of Beirut.  All these damaged goods (plus others still) reveal fascinating cracks, their mechanisms of self-protection intrigue as well, & they come together warily, gingerly, movingly.  When violence is done, it's the innocent who suffer, & when healing occurs, it's never without scars.  No, Lauren Davis has no truck with clich&eacute; or easy answer.  Her very title comes from Le Corbusier, a bad idea of his about how to house a city's underclass.  At its best her reframing of that notion brings to life the fragility of all the world's gilded palaces; it brings off a powerful reminder that there is no Magic Kingdom.",5,"The fragile. the beautiful, the scarred, the ever-intense",1280102400,"07 26, 2010"
A1D2S70Q0VPXAD,000200576X,Linda C.

The kind of novel you want to read slowly so you can savor each page. The kind of book with word images like this: ""It is almost dawn, when the sun is still hidden behind the buildings, but through the green leaves of the bamboo that grow in front of Saida's windows, comes the argent promise of impending light.""You will find many of these beautifully crafted sentences in this story of an emotionally shattered war correspondent who holes up in a tiny Paris apartment to write his memoir. The Radiant City was the first book I read entirely on my new Kindle, and for the duration, it went with me everywhere.

What happened in Israel to traumatize Matthew Bowles? Will Saida, the Lebanese single mother, manage to keep her son, Joseph, from joining a violent gang? What is Jack Sadler, ex-mercenary and Vietnam vet, trying so hard to forget?

A1TB4FNVY9X104,0002005808,"Gabriel Boutros ""Author of The Guilty""",0,0,"River City is a long, rambling tale that manages against all odds to entertainingly combine a murder investigation which begins in 1955 with a history of Montreal, beginning with the arrival of Jacques Cartier to its shores in 1535. The link between the two events is a jewel-encrusted dagger which is given to Cartier by a tribe of local natives. Some believe it has mystical powers, others are willing to kill for it because of its incredible value. Farrow gives readers an action-filled Montreal history lesson, following the ""Cartier Dagger"" as it's passed down through the ages, telling the tale of the establishment of a settlement by French explorers, the city which grew in its place, the wars against the natives and the British, and so on. In the more ""modern"" era, from the Rocket Richard hockey riot in 1955, through the Quiet Revolution which signaled the awakening of French nationalism in Quebec, up to the bombings and kidnappings of the October crisis in the early 1970s, Detective &Eacute;mile Cinq-Mars doggedly searches for the people who murdered a local hood and may have stolen the dagger. Historical characters mix with Montreal's police force and underworld in a story which by all rights should be awkward and impossible to follow. It is, instead, a fascinating look back at what went into the founding and creation of Montreal, the constant linguistic tensions between English and French, and the political manipulation that led to the body of a man found with a priceless relic piercing his heart on the night local hockey fans rampaged through the city streets to protest the suspension of their legendary hero, Maurice Rocket Richard.

Farthing's Fortunes is an out-there novel, a fairly interesting romp, though too anti-US for my taste. Final Things is a fascinating and absolutely terrifying novel, but a bit of a train wreck. The Teacher's Daughter has aged very, very badly but is nonetheless captivating, and Sunset Manor is just goofy. There are others, of course, but I haven't gotten to all of them yet.Wright is a great story-teller, and he mostly goes to the same well each time: take a super-ordinary nobody and see how he/she reacts in a difficult situation. And just report what happens. No embellishment. He mixes it up as best he can, straying somewhat from the formula in a novel such as October, but mostly he just sticks to the plan.In Adultery, the plan finally fell flat. Not that Adultery is uninteresting, and it's probably RBW's most sincere attempt to throw an average Joe into a very bad situation, and then to just honestly recount what happens, with no embellishment, no subtext, no metaphors, just straight story. Usually it works pretty well, but in Adultery it's just too dry and plain. The desire to tell it straight and not jazz it up at all, while admirable, leaves the reader unsatisfied this time. It almost seems it might have been written in a few weeks, with RBW just letting his character's distress flow out uninterrupted and unfiltered onto the page.

Forgoing the usual stereotypes oftenemployed in describing the office, Robinson has given us a complexcharacter who seeks, though cognizant of his own frailty, to accounthonestly for his own life, and through whom we as readers might bechallenged to better account for our own.This would be a fine book to chew through slowly.

Left alone, Vera travels with her grandfather's widow to Japan to live among the ama divers, women who live with unprecedented freedom.  Used to loss, Vera exhibits a skittishness in joining the life of her new village, is slow to trust and slowly begins to develop her own luster as she takes control of her destiny.  Vera slowly learns the skills of the ama divers while gaining a sense of her own identity, defined by who she is rather than by those who have left her.Alternating between Vera's story and that of her family, we slowly gain an understanding of what has driven them in their passion for pearls.  The shadowy world of Japan fighting a battle for Asian domination is the perfect foil for Vera's tale.This is a quiet, intimate novel with a shifting surface, as changeable as the pearl at the heart of the tale.  The language is enthralling and Katherine Govier evokes a time and location that to many is shrouded with mystery.Three Views of Crystal Water is a window into a story overlooked by many when studying World War II.

For one thing, Wolfe could easily have shed 150-200 pages off the total page count. Charlotte's ruminations as events progress start to repeat and repeat and repeat...we get it already, Tom! The girl wants to be &quot;cool&quot;!Other reviewers have questioned Wolfe's vernacular, which I think is missing the point in a social satire. Kids (and these are very much kids) may not say these exact phrases at your alma mater today, but that doesn't mean they aren't saying them elsewhere or that the meaning's in any way unclear. I can tell you from experience that the &quot;F--k Patois&quot; is universal.The other not-necessarily-terrible-but-still-disconcerting thing is that Wolfe's plot meanders hither and yon: it's there, but this book is largely a collection of scenes rather than a flowing work. Minor nitpick: my God, this guy uses more italics than Cosmopolitan.The good things about this novel are many, and largely offset the bad. The last point first: what scenes! They ooze reality and dramatic tension, and some of them are laugh-out-loud funny.I found myself rooting for different characters throughout the novel (my interest in Charlotte deteriorated as her angst increased). Some of the lesser lights are very well drawn. I thought Jojo and Adam were particularly well crafted. Wolfe's also got a real turn of phrase. Most importantly, he's managed to nail down a piece of collegiate darkness and shove it out into the light for us to see...and any reader saying things can't be THAT bad is fooling himself.)In short, I enjoyed this read almost in spite of myself.",3,Uneven,1126137600,"09 8, 2005"

His health is failing, particularly after completing a difficult pilgrimmage and following a lifetime of rich foods and richer drinks. Before long, you'll know more about the bard's growing gastro-intestinal problems than you might have wanted.The narrative sets the stage for a turbulent time in Ireland's history, and readers will learn a great deal about the issues and opinions of the time.

Though Rachlis doesn't set out to reveal the influences on our doctors that make them 'say and do' the things they 'say and do' this is one of his unintentional achievements - a significant contribution to empowering the patient in their own care.In this book we quickly understand how the 'fee-for-service' penalizes doctors who spend time with patients - impacting listening, attitude, diagnosis and treatment. We rapidly appreciate the physician's lack of access to other professionals and their non-drug therapies - a void eagerly filled by pharmaceutical companies who often establish relationships with doctors before they even leave medical school! And we recognize the seemingly endless waiting lists for an array of diagnostic procedures. With a grasp of the many influences behind a diagnosis we can become participants in our own care.The real goal behind 'Prescription for Excellence' is to reveal a path to improved health care through the nurturing of innovative programs, models and techniques. Like any system, our health care system is &quot;perfectly designed to get the outcomes it produces&quot; and while we tend to focus on privatization or increased funding as a source of improvement Rachlis explores an alternative. Many programs in Canada, the US and Europe have succeeded in creating service improvements that channel non-hospital care away from hospitals - thereby reducing costs. Cultivating innovation and weeding out the obstacles to its growth may encourage these programs to grow beyond the conditions required for germination.We may not all share Rachlis confidence in health care teams or his optimism for call centers, but overall there is something for everyone and understanding the pitfalls and strengths of the system is the first step to turning it to our advantage.Angela HobbsAuthor of 'The Sick House Survival Guide; Simple Steps to Healthier Homes.'",5,Questions Answered,1086134400,"06 2, 2004"

However, what Canada's role in the world should be is a very controversial topic at this point in history, because the world is in the process of shifting from a unipolar to a multipolar distribution of power.In the year 2000, few people would have been able to predict the bizarre string of events which started with September 11, 2001 and the equally bizarre American reaction to this attack. Benjamin Barber had correctly predicted a &quot;Jihad vs. McWorld&quot;; Michael Adams had correctly predicted that the US would continue to drift toward right-wing Christian evangelism. But the way all of this has played out in the attack on Iraq and the response to this attack around the world was arguably impossible to accurately foresee.Canada is left in the difficult position of being tied to the United States in terms of economics, while being tied to Western Europe in terms of its postmaterialist values (cf. Jeremy Rifkin's European Dream).The fundamentalist Muslim threat is real. However the evangelical Christian threat is also real. Both groups are keen on seeing the world as being engaged in an apocalyptic &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;, an interpretation hard to believe and even harder to desire for Canadians and Europeans whose values continue to progress, rather than to regress to religious barbarism.Jennifer Welsh wants our future course to &quot;be rooted in our history&quot;. Unfortunately history is not necessarily a reliable guide in a time of paradigm shift.Historically Germany was &quot;the bad guy&quot; but this is clearly no longer the case. And historically, at least from Canadians' perspective, the US was the good guy. However, according to a recent poll in Time Canada (November 1, 2004), Canadians now see the US more as &quot;World Bully&quot; (54%) than as &quot;World police officer&quot; (37%).Where do Canadians go from here?

It is a departure from Lucy Waverman's earlier books, in its particular attention to more formal occasions rather than weekday meals, and thus filled a much needed niche in my cookbook collection.Ms. Waverman has carefully created seasonal menus, some more general, others appropriate to particular occasions (Thanksgiving, Burns Night, Christmas, New Years, Passover, etc.), and James Chatto has paired these menus with wine suggestions. Dispersed throughout the book are informative discussions of particular aspects of matching food and drinks; decanting, sherry, or brining a turkey, etc.When having company, it's nice to know that someone has done the worrying about wine and appetizers for you, and you can feel entirely safe in the steady hands of Waverman &amp; Chatto. The food, while up-to-date, is not glaringly trendy (i.e. lemongrass and cilantro in everything) or dull (full flavoured, yes, but concussive, no). The wine suggestions are not unreasonable either; Chatto does not call for a specific vintner or vintage, but takes a more universal approach (he calls for a valipolicella classico, for instance, rather than a Masi Valpolicella classico, thus departing from the pattern of his Food &amp; Wine recommendations).The food is delicious, and the bits of information and history surrounding it make this a wonderful book to read as well as cook from; the photography decadent; the writing is the closest thing to Nigella Lawson's sumptuous prose we have in the Canadian market.The onion tarts and the roast beef in a mustard-rosemary rub are my favourites so far - and the accompanying gravy is divine.I have not given the book four stars only because it doesn't attain the diverse utility of a compendium like the Joy of Cooking.

And the morale-sapping myth of Canada as a nation of ""peacekeepers"" is exposed in all its fraudulent glory.But Granatstein, like many of his opponents on the left, goes on to make that classic Canadian mistake of confusing a strong defence posture with greater continental integration. Make the military bigger, he says, while at the same time start cooperating more closely with Washington.Granatstein seems not to consider the possibility that Canada needs a stronger military to safeguard Canadian interests abroad and sovereignty at home on its own terms, rather than to blindly support U.S. foreign policy. His critique of Jean Chretien for keeping Canada out of the U.S.-led blunder in Iraq, for example, now looks particularly ill-chosen in retrospect.While sharing Granatstein's disgust at the damage and humiliation that politicians and bureaucrats have forced on Canada's military, one still can't help but wonder whether he really wants to save our military and restore its pride, or just set up a local recruiting depot for the U.S. military. Even most of the new equipment he suggests acquiring comes from the United States, with very little from Europe or Britain.Nevertheless, this is a book that every Canadian should read.

Granatstein's book takes us on a non-stop thrillride of political bungling, misallocation, misinterpretation, and ultimately neglect of Canada's armed forces. The sad thing is he's right on most accounts - Canada has willfully neglected her armed forces for a myriad of reasons over an extended period of time. This in itself is regrettable and I agree with Granatstein that it has seriously eroded the ability of Canada to defend herself and her interests, at least as a political entity.  This neglect has likewise eroded Canada's importance as a peacekeeper nation.But you'll have to forgive my idealism when I reject Granatstein's assertion that we need to kowtow to the United States in order to assert our sovereignty. Since when was it dependent on how well we conform to the imperial ambitions of our neighbours to the south anyhow? The ""War on Terror"" is turning out to be a total sham, wreathed in lies, racism, imperialist hubris, religious zealotry, and the seemingly inexhaustible capacity of the current US administration to be stupid. Furthermore, armed forces don't necessarily need to exist to ""fight wars"". What's wrong with relegating Canada's armed forces to a constabulary role? We have never fought wars of aggression or retribution, opting instead to come to the aid of those whose fates dictated their involvement in just such conflicts (Russia and the Boers notwithstanding). And much like the rousing of the sleeping giant, we've always managed to muster the resources necessary for the task at hand when it came to hand. The questionable spectre of Islamic terror is a poor excuse to gird for battle, especially given the fact that as of this date, we, at least directly, are in no way affected by it. Certainly the economic fallout is there, but neither bomb, nor anthrax, nor body count, nor ""terror alert level"" has made its way into the vernacular of daily life in Canada as yet.Coincidence? Perhaps. Or is it something else? Perhaps it's our connection to Europe that has entrenched in us a love of social progress, or maybe we're just nave. Whatever the reason, this is not, nor has it ever been, a nation of belligerents. It is a nation of the reticent - of people who love the fact that they can travel abroad without fear of recrimination, who can walk down streets without fear of gun-toting reactionaries at every doorstep, and who don't rely on weapons to settle our differences be they internal or external.

He discusses both the military atttitudes of the time, and the policies of the government.  He is even handed (for instance, he concedes many of the positive aspects of integration while at the same time identifying the harmful effects of Unification) and at the same time ruthless.Unlike many critiques, Granatstein ends up with some constructive suggestions.  Readers might like to compare and contrast his conclusions with those in TARNISHED BRASS, which also has a prescription for reviving the military.The latest version of this book carries us up to Paul Martin's election victory and is therefore rather current.Recommended, probably moreso than Bercuson's SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT which also covers the same topic, and much less muckracking that TARNISHED BRASS.",5,Granatstein is as illuminating as ever,1108252800,"02 13, 2005"

Mr. Granatstein does an outstanding job of explaining his choices of reasons why the Canadian Forces (CF) has fallen into a state of disrepair. Peacekeeping vice training and equiping the military for general combat has lulled the Canadian population into thinking that we have a ready band of do-gooders in uniform instead of a cohesive fighting force. Diefenbaker, Trudeau, Mulroney and Chretien - the latter being the worst of the bunch - all destroyed the foundations required to field a capable military force.Mr. Granatstein does not espouse the need of a million person military nor does he say that the military requires all the bells and whistles our friends south of the border employ.  His argument is simple: give the small military we have direction (through REAL leadership) and equip them with the tools they require to get the job done, whether it be supporting a coalition effort or an aid to civil power operation domestically. It should be noted that the book is not a collection of woes and complaints, it also provides some viable solutions to the issues faced by the CF.  The only caviat he had placed on these solutions is that something has to be done NOW.All in all, the book was an easy read and well argued,  I urge all Canadians, whether they care about the military or not, to read this book and feel the pulse of the current state of the CF before it flat lines.",5,An important read,1077753600,"02 26, 2004"

Just in case you are not up on your early history. Set in the same time period though, that of the eight century in the Orkney Islands at the tip of Scotland. The book is firmly grounded in its medieval historical setting. While no famous personages make appearances except for a passing remark about St. Brendan, the monk that myth tells us sailed the seas in a coracle, the Vikings are the looming threat to these peaceful people of the dragons.The book starts off immediately with Madoca, a slave girl, being chosen as the new Dragon Seer apprentice and going off to live in seclusion with a small group of people who look after the Dragons. But the Dragons are really there to look after the people; they have memorized the lore, history, laws of the ancients and all that came before and through them the people can have the knowledge of the past, as they are a people without a written language. Madoca learns from the dragons, and learns how to access and use the magic of earth. She is surprisingly a powerful receptacle for the magic, much more so than anyone has seen in some time. Danger threatens the dragons from one side and the life of the people is threatened from more than one side. After only a year of apprenticeship, can Madoca save the dragons.This is a beautiful story! The dragons are not what one expects. McNaughton has made them long, slender, agile and yet ungainly when they walk on the land. They are much more like the dragons of the East as they fly in the air and form knots together, each with special meaning. They don't breath fire, but they can speak the language of the people when taught as hatchlings. They communicate with each other, and teach the dragon seers, by projecting feelings over any amount of distance. The writing is lyrical yet simple and there is a mystical atmosphere throughout the book. Madoca starts off at 14 years of age and grows as a person through the story as her character moves through the various stages of her life, maturing and at first doubting, then accepting the important role she is destined to play in the future. The book ends in a complete and satisfactory ending making it feel as if it could be a stand-alone book, but I see that this Fall a second book will be published whether it be a companion or the next in a trilogy I can't find any information. I'll definitely be adding it to my list though.I'm very pleased to have found Canadian author Janet McNaughton this way. I'm afraid I've never heard of her before and she has an impressive backlist of books including historical fantasy, historical fiction and dystopia.

The friend, Gabriel, still cutting an impressive figure despite his age and being wheelchair bound, was easy to recognize. Gabriel is confronting questions of life's value and mortality and, having decided on a definite course of action, urges James to accompany him on a special journey. James, on a visit from Canada to spend time with his gravely ill daughter, has his own anxieties to deal with. Why should he embark on the trip with Gabriel? Why would Gabriel even consider him as a companion after all these years? The summer the two spent together in 1944 on the Quebec coast was far from being all fun and harmony and the friendship did not survive the strains. As he reflects on the invitation, his mind drifts back to that memorable holiday that also led to his budding emotional and sexual awakening.Written in the first person, James' voice is personal and sincere. While recalling the details of that unforgettable summer, his romantic feelings for Odette, the girl next door, and his competing with Gabriel for her favours, he can now critically appraise his behaviour with the benefit of hindsight. Gabriel, although confined to his wheelchair as a result of a polio infection, was the centre of attention, flamboyant and self confident. James was more withdrawn and shy and resented to be called upon to serve the older friend's whims. Feelings were fragile and Odette appeared to be the most mature among the friends. Through her story the reader is given a glimpse into the economic conditions of the time that separated the wealthy vacationers from the locals. ""Spotting subs"", one of the boys distractions, alludes to the war far away.Pondering these recollections, James is pulled back into the present through concerns for his daughter. What will the doctors' verdict be? Father and daughter had always been close, in contrast to his relationship with his son, and her move to England not long ago had required major adjustments. Having lost his wife to cancer some years earlier, his daughter now might face the same fate, possibly leaving him bereft of the two most loved people in his life.Wright writes in an calm and fluid style, drawing the reader into this gentle and tender story from the first page. His meditation on family, the end of childhood, friendships and the inevitability of death are personal as well as universal. Nothing is overwrought or heavy handed. His characters are vividly drawn and, in particular, the young people are utterly believable in their daily banter. The Gasp&eacute; coast and the small town of Perc&eacute; provide a great setting and Wright's knowledge of and affection for this landscape is evident in his description.

A1OM1ORZYCZ8VY,0002007207,"Friederike Knabe ""Books are funny little port...",1,1,"... we don't exist at all"", ponders Sharon Butala as she completes the narrative circle of this disconcerting and poignant book. Her resolve to tell Alexandra's story, as fully as she possibly can, grew over the period of forty years.  Starting from an indescribable, vague curiosity about the fate of the young woman she knew as a young girl the feeling grew into a pledge and at times an obsession. In the final outcome, much more is being shared in this haunting, yet beautifully rendered ""meditation on friendship, memory and murder"". Comparable to her other non-fiction work, such asPerfection of the Morning: A Woman's Awaking in Nature, Butala, an award winning Canadian author, brings personal memoir, historical facts and context, and her deeply felt connection to the natural environment together in one fluidly written, moving account.In ""The Girl in Saskatoon"" Butala embeds a real-life murder mystery into a sensitive,  detailed portrait of two girls, Alex and herself, and their time and social environment. Uncompromisingly honest, she reflects on both their lives, comparing parallels and differences in their background and upbringing, always searching for clues that could lift the cloak of secrecy that lies over the case.The factual details of the murder are clear as they are brutal: a twenty-three-year old nursing student, a popular beauty queen, was viciously murdered in Saskatoon on May 18 1962. Her body was found on May 30, but her killer or killers were not caught. Not only family and friends, the whole city was in shock; murders were extremely rare in Saskatchewan (and in Canada) in the early sixties. While Sharon knew Alex from school and related activities, they had not been close friends. Nevertheless, for some initially indefinable reason she felt troubled by what happened to Alex and why. Over many years, she could not forget the events of the time and started collecting whatever evidence she could find: press materials, interviews of police investigators and of some of those who were the last to see Alex alive on that fateful day. Slowly, her research became known locally, leading not only to new information being offered to her, but also some disturbing indications of surveillance. Aiming more than anything to write a portrait of the girl who was Alex, Butala embarked on a physical and mental journey of discovery and learning that she could not have foreseen.While the events described and her in-depth reflections are understandably centred on Saskatoon and the province of Saskatchewan, Butala's account has meaning far beyond the local. The account of the inadequate, to say the least, handling of the murder investigation that lasted decades, provides food for thought: evidence was not properly secured; not all witnesses were interviewed nor obvious leads pursued. While new DNA technology allows for identification of criminals long after the event, will it bring this investigation to a close?  The book also raises important generational questions, among others, concerning young women's potential and restrictions, growing up in the post-war years into the early sixties; the dubious role of the beauty pageant system that catapulted girls like Alex, unprepared for the ensuing pressure, into local prominence.  An important book for all these reasons.  [Friederike Knabe]",5,"""Without stories...",1217980800,"08 6, 2008"
AAR8E3JF9K93P,0002007207,"Tina ""Tina""",0,0,"I had mixed emotions reading this book. I am not usually a huge fan of true crime, but this book is really more than just about the 1962 murder of Alexandra Wiwcharuk and who did it. As a matter of fact, while there are alot of theories out there and the police can actually retrace most of the victims actions just before her murder - there has never been a person accused and prosecuted for this crime.The author has a personal bias here as she was personally acquainted with the victim. They were friends and had lived many things together. With the arrival of DNA tests, there is hope that the semen samples and the hair that was found (Alex fought for her life) can now be analyzed, but what makes this book more than just your standard true crime is the intense personal feelings the author feels for this particular murder.Of course, because of the close, personal relationship between Sharon and Alex, the story gets intensely personal and you can feel the author's pain as she tries to make some sens of the situation.It is obvious to me, that Sharon also feels some guilt - as she tries to work out through the telling of this story - why one person is targeted for murder while the other one (who although living a different life - in a different place) is exempt.This book is very introspective and is very broody.I enjoyed this read, but felt frustrated that the guilty person has never been found - it feels like somebody told me a story and ripped out the last page.",3,Murder in Saskatoon,1212192000,"05 31, 2008"

AWEJ5JKD3MQMU,000200724X,"Timothy J. Bazzett ""BookHappy""",2,2,"Just a few months ago I'd never heard of Linden MacIntyre, although he is apparently rather famous in Canada as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker and has won numerous awards in these fields. Maybe that shows just how ""separate but equal"" the U.S. and Canada still are in many respects. In any case, a writer friend, Ed Hannibal, happened to mention to me in an email this book, ""The Bishop's Man,"" which was the #1 bestselling novel in Canada last year. It was all about the sexual abuse scandals that rocked the Catholic Church back in the 80s and beyond. Apparently the problem was every bit as serious in Canada as it was here in the U.S. and other countries. I've already read and reviewed (5 big stars) that book not too long ago. And I loved it so much that I took a look at what else MacIntyre has written, and found this book, CAUSEWAY, a memoir of his boyhood in the 1950s in a small village, Port Hastings, on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia.Since MacIntyre and I are nearly the same age and both grew up Catholic in small towns, I found much here to relate to. But there is also a unique frame to this story, which places a major emphasis on the changes that came to Cape Breton during and after the four-to-five year construction of the Canso Causeway (which displaced more than ten million tons of rock from the brow of Cape Porcupine on the mainland side into the strait), which linked the remote island not just to the western part of the province, but to the rest of the world, or so it seemed to the small boy, Linden MacIntyre, an endlessly curious kid who wanted to know things, and read all he could get his hands on. He wonders what he'll turn out to be, but to me it was pretty obvious. Here are a few telling phrases, all on one page (p. 152 pb copy) -""I found a book ...""""I get books from a library ...""""I've been reading books ...""""I look for books ...""""I follow the news ..."" and""I'm beginning to realize how dangerous and interesting the world really is. And I can hardly wait to be a part of it.""Linden MacIntyre began a life-long love affair with words and books early on. Perhaps because of his isolated Catholic upbringing, like me, he toyed with the idea of the priesthood for a time, but it was no surprise to me that he became a writer.There are a lot of very special things about this book and one of them is the importance placed on family during MacIntyre's childhood, and on customs and traditions. His family was Scotch and Irish and his portrayals of his grandparents and uncles and cousins who live on the mountain ""out back"" and his descriptions of things like wakes, funerals and simple visits there are priceless. MacIntyre tends to repeat certain facts and stories about his people, much like haunting refrains found in old folk ballads. This gives the book a special sort of feel, I think.Probably the real focal point of CAUSEWAY is not so much the construction of the causeway and the outward changes it wrought in the the community, but the disjointed and complicated relationship the author endured and enjoyed with his mostly absent father, a ""hard-rock miner"" who was on the road, working underground in distant provinces during most of Linden's boyhood. Dan Rory MacIntyre didn't have much luck. Locals and family even suggested he might have been ""cursed"" with bad luck as a young man. In any case, he was seldom home. As a boy, Linden longed for his father's presence and his love. He knew instinctively that he had the latter; he just wished there were more of the former. He makes a very telling observation about relationships between parents and children near the end of the book, in this passage -""By the time you're old enought to command their serious attention as another adult, you're living away from them, and the only opportunities that arise for a meeting of minds are ceremonial - birth, marriage, death ...""Too true, Linden. I know just exactly what you mean. Fathers are so very important, and yet so often remain distant, mysteries throughout our lives, until it's too late.Linden MacIntyre has known his share of success and even fame. He has come a long way from his humble origins. But he has never forgotten them, and is still trying to understand their importance in who he is. He writes, ""I've spent years struggling to understand this phenomenon of identity - understanding who you are by knowing where you're from.""Makes sense to me. Maybe he's finally figured it out. One thing I know for sure. He's one hell of a fine writer. So now I'm going to look for his other novel.

AC4XV78EJG1QB,0002007649,Anne,5,8,"I just finished reading this book.  It is interesting to me that many of the reviews focus on his chapter on Milk.  I didn't take that much from that chapter, but simply that the verdict isn't really out on Milk.  I think he would have done better to address the question of raw or pasteurized--another big subject of debate.  But, that logically must come from the belief first that milk is good for you and I didn't really feel that he made a decisive decision about it though he leaned more towards milk than away from it.There were several things I enjoyed about this book.  I enjoyed learning a lot of nutritional history--like the history of vitamins and how different things in our food (like canola oil) were developed.  There were also interesting chapters about various vitamins.  I now finally understand why there are vitamins B6 and B12, but not B7 and B8 (they were originally named and then discarded because people realized they had no nutritional value).  There was a very interesting (to me) chapter about detox diets and the lack of scientific evidence that they do any good.  In fact, there is no evidence that there are health benefits to them.But, the reason I haven't given it 4 or 5 stars, is that the author leans heavily towards the opinion that chemicals in our food is just fine.  Even given his scientific evidence, I am not fully persuaded.  Many of the things he talked about haven't been around for years, so we don't know their long term effects.  It was just this year that several reports were published stating that artificial sweeteners are digested the same as regular sugar and do not contribute to weightloss.

A26BWRBPP4V2WF,0002007649,Craig MACKINNON,0,1,"Near the end of the book, Joe Schwarcz quotes Mark Twain's famous maxim that ""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.""  If (some of) the reviews for this book are any indication, Dr. Joe was right: scientific scrutiny is unlikely to change anyone's mind.  People continue to smoke, people continue to eat mostly red meat, etc.  Those people who eat red meat and smoke are often willing to admit they are participating in unhealthy behaviour.  So much more, then, is it difficult or impossible to convince people through the scientific literature that their preconceived notions are not correct when the topic is not something for which literally billions of people have served as experimental subjects (through their normal activities).  That is an observation that is mostly independent of the book's qualities as prose and entertainment, but it does identify the point from which this book starts.In a series of bite-sized chapters (3-5 pages), Schwarcz takes us through some of the topics he's encountered and researched in his role as a science commentator over the last 30 (?) years.  As such, I would suggest that the topics are a little skewed to the supplements side - there are many chapters devoted to particular dietary supplements with supposedly miraculous effects (to cure cancer, lose weight, etc.).  These claims are usually laughably easy to dismiss because the ""evidence"" of their efficacy is non-existent.  The book is much more interesting when he tackles issues of pesticides, teflon, and artificial sweeteners.  Generally, the scientific literature shows that the amounts of these items in an average diet are so small as to be non-issues.  Sure, they cause cancer - in amounts millions of times as large as humans take in.  And these amounts are far less than the naturally occurring carcinogens that we are exposed to automatically because we breath and eat food.  This leads to the primary thesis of the book, with which no nutritional expert could argue: eat a good balanced diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.This thesis is proven again and again throughout the book, and the primary problem of this book is its repetative nature.  In trying to keep each chapter reasonably autonomous, and because the conclusions are virtually the same each time, the author cannot possibly make the book entertaining for long reading times.  It's more of a ""pick up, read a bit, put down for a couple days"" kind of book.Other reviewers have objected to the lack of footnotes.  This is a valid criticism; I suppose it was a conscious choice on the author's and editor's parts (for ease of readability).  Certainly I would have prefered if the studies he cites were more clearly referenced.  (Rise and Fall of the Third Reich had thousands of references, so it's insulting to think that the reader would pass on buying the book simply because they are in there, especially as this book's raison d'etre is to bring to the public the objective scientific conclusions on the nutritional questions raised in the book).  I would add the criticism that two hot-button nutritional issues are not dealt with.  (1) Bisphenol-A, a monomer used in polycarbonate synthesis, has been banned by Health Canada and others, but ruled safe (in the amounts present in polycarbonate drinking and storage vessels) by the FDA.  Based on the number of articles I see (in newspapers and even the American Chemical Society's magazine), this chemical is perfectly positioned for the Dr. Joe treatment, and I find it curious that it is omitted.  (2) Perhaps because this movement has only gained real traction since the book was written it was not included, but the ""eat local"" mantra is in conflict with the ""eat lots of variety"" mantra espoused by nutritionists and featured prominently in the book.  If you live in a breadbasket (e.g. California), you can have a widely varied diet throughout the year.  If you live in a northern clime (e.g. northern Minnesota, most of Canada), you will not have access to locally grown fresh fruit and veggies for most of the year.  Eating as Dr. Schwarcz suggests would leave you with an enormous carbon footprint due to the transportation and refrigeration costs of moving the food from southern locations.It is also curious that Dr. Joe never mentions the placebo effect.  Some remedies are effective because the patient thinks they will be effective.  Sure, double-blind studies take this into account (people receiving the placebo and the test compound are both going to benefit from the placebo effect, so any additional effect in the test group will be due to the efficacy of the test compound), but anecdotal ""evidence"" is easy to accumulate by charletons, and these testamonials can certainly be true!  If you're one of the lucky ones whose cancer goes into remission at the same time as you started drinking three litres of acai juice a day, you will certainly ""know"" that the acai juice caused the remission.  So it's my unfortunate conclusion that Dr. Joe is singing to the choir with this book - those with a scientific/statistical background will be convinced, but we were convinced anyways.  Those who are the statistical outliers will still be convinced of their positions, and the charletans will continue to make money off of them.",3,"Some neat tidbits, but it's somewhat repetative and unfortunately it's unlikely to change anyone's mind",1257120000,"11 2, 2009"

I can honestly say that the majority (though not all) of it falls in line with the research I've personally gone through on a variety of the subject matter. One of the pitfalls of nutrition though is reductionism (science at it's core being), whereby we are more and more starting to view food as chemical compounds, rather than food. You don't eat calcium (unless it's a supplement), you consume food.Overall this book is a good reference book that offers the scientists point of view on food. Like it or not we have entered a scientific food era, and as the world's population increases so will our nutritional demands and the impact of science on that (somewhat unfortunately) will be prevalent as we try to squeeze more efficiency out of limited amounts of land, while trying to minimize our environmental impact and other public health factors. Luckily enough you still have a choice surrounding the other 'non-scientific' components of food, like where your food comes from, what conditions was it raised in, where will you eat it, and with whom. Take this book as only one very small component of diet and nutrition.Two of the most important concepts:1 - Toxicity (Poison) is a matter of dosage. Many people do not realize this, but foods really becomes toxic when their exposure to certain chemicals exceeds a certain threshold, or you consume so much of one type of food that you introduce too much of certain chemical compounds naturally found in the food (whether organic, biodiverse, or industrially produced).2 - There are still a lot of unknowns about nutrition and we are making discoveries every day that refute or support various existing beliefs. There are most likely hundreds if not thousands of compounds yet to be discovered and we still know very little about how certain chemicals compounds interact with other chemical compounds within the bodyDownsides?1 - This book is 6 years old, and new research can refute some of it already.2 - He cites many studies in line, but chose to omit an appendix with references (to me this is very odd for an academic who would be used to this requirement in his academic work).3 - It is NOT a diet book, and there is very little actual dietary advice, which I do not feel would be the author's place to recommend either given his background. This book is more of a reference book, or a coffee table book, something someone can sift through quickly on a variety of nutrition debates.",4,Key Insights from the Scientist's Point of View,1357689600,"01 9, 2013"

His book is indeed a full-course meal...and then some.First, he leads us through a tour of naturally occurring substances in our food supply, including flax, fiber,  omega-3 fats, antioxidants, flavanols, vitamins, and minerals. Next, he presents the most controversial issues related to the manipulation of our food supply: fortifying with  iron and fluoride;  sweetening with natural and artificial sweeteners; manipulating genes in our food; and preserving with sulphites, viruses, and radiation. Then, he takes us up close and personal with the contaminants in our food supply, including pesticides, hormones, BPA, PCBs, and dioxins. And, finally, Joe leads us through the nutritional hype surrounding some of the latest nutritional fads such as goji juice, detoxing, DHEA, and green tea.It's likely your head will be spinning after consuming all the nutritional chemistry, controversy and and commentary that Joe serves up. (And, to answer his question above: yes, it is a lot to digest!) He does do an impressive job in guiding us through the maze of myths, misconceptions and truths about the foods we eat, but--as food science is rarely a conclusive one--be prepared to be confused at times.  Fortunately, Joe offers relief at the end of the book, to help us digest it all:""There is more to life than worrying about every morsel of food we put into our mouths. What matters is the overall diet...When you carefully scrutinize the scientific studies that are being rolled out almost on a daily basis, most amount to no more than tinkering with the basic nutritional principles we have tried to lay down: eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and don't overeat.""Whew.",4,Phew and whew.,1274572800,"05 23, 2010"

It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis:  that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle.  There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement.

A359IT81FBX64Y,0002007649,Steven Mason,12,17,"Schwarcz is a Professor of Chemistry who has written several books about diet and nutrition. Judging by this book I'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.I'm not saying that Schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?I majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can't really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about ""the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat."" Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be ""an occasional treat,"" and even then the portion size ""should cover a small portion of the plate."" Those people who still believe in the ""myth"" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz's book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.I can't forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that ""Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy."" Schwarcz responds by saying, ""True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle."" He leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the ""very different diet and lifestyle"" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study ""which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures."" Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who ""criticizes"" milk consumption as part of the ""antimilk lobby,"" driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we ""look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium."" Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses ""antimilk"" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).This is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that ""leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.""? I'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk ""is not a poison,"" as some fringe members of PETA might say.In conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. You know the drill: Eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest.

A1EX319KWE81UL,0002007649,Warren Green,8,21,"I bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books at amazon.ca. I've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled ""Milk and Calcium"", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a ""nutrition authority"".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.Don't Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World's Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, ""Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!"" He fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, ""But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture"".""The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning.""( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the ""breast milk"" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) ""That's hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.""He tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this ""self-selected subgroup"". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a ""trace of dioxin"". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring ""water"" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, ""A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.""Of course he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their ""natural"" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while ""milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA"".Webster's Dictionary defines poison as, ""a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill"".It's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While ""milk and calcium"" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility.

There was more to see and to feel in the older Jacob.  The younger Jacob was clumsily constructed and unbelievable, for example, how out of the blue he showed up to a dog-eat-dog place to be having an affair with ease with the wife of the most dangerous and powerful man in the show!  It was the depression after all and there were a lot, a lot of more than qualified people looking for work!

The photos at the beginning of each chapters are actually more interesting.What are all the buzzes about? ... The comments on this site indicate that this book is a hit!

A1HRYC60VTMYC0,0002007770,Ace,5,8,"Jacob's life takes a drastic turn when his parents die. Stripped of everything he owns, everything familiar to him, all the comforts of his college and family life that he took for granted, he leaves his old life behind, jumps a train that turns out to be a circus train, and enters a totally new, different world. A circus is fun, right? Not behind the scenes, in this book. Jacob, a young adult, naive, still a virgin, unused to such a hard life on the road, confronts danger, murder, hatred, love, callous human viciousness, more danger, and finds friends and allies (not all of them human) in the unlikeliest of places.The story is told in turn, by the nonogenarian Jacob now in a nursing home, and at other times, by the twenty-something Jacob working at the circus and trying not to get killed -- mostly at the hands of his fellow-human-associates. Every chapter is an adventure, held my attention and took turns gladdening, saddening and surprising me.The circus animals also get into the act in this book and the author's sensitive rendering and treatment of them makes them all the more vivid, as ""supporting actors"",  Circus ""employees"", and fellow participants in the intrigue and action.A masterful ending -- leaving the reader with hope, glee and wonder.

This story is lacking in authenticity; neither the actions nor the emotions are believable, and the elephant-keeping, as described, is insane. The author claims that many of the events in this book actually happened, but having them all occur in the space of three month puts them in the realm of fantasy.  When author describes her research for this novel, it sounds like research for a term paper, and a term paper-novel sums up its quality very well.

A1QZ6MFP9TSQU6,0002007770,acid_raine_burns,1,1,"What can I say? I'm not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book. From the prologue, this book held my attention. Gruen's writing style and attention to detail is simply amazing! At several points, I felt as though I was actually watching the show or walking beside Jacob while working in the menagerie. It felt real. And the perverse, morbid sense of humor she gives Jacob as an elderly gentleman is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Although, I must admit, I found myself fuming over the treatment of our senior citizens. That, however, is a rant for another time!The characters in this book are so rich and deep. It was hard not to form some sort of fondness for them. In addition, I found it amazing that Gruen was able to turn Rosie into a full character without completely humanizing her. Even though I have a strong bond to animals, I still felt a close connection to Rosie.From a lot of her terminology, knowledge of trains, animals, freaks, etc., I really think that Gruen did a lot of research before writing this book. It makes it a lot more authoritative and realistic. While the story itself is fiction, it makes it that much more believable and credible to be interspersed with fact.I will say that the happy ending, Jacob's extreme sensitivity, etc. might be seen as extremely campy. However, I felt that Gruen was trying to find something positive during the Depression. I feel that she did try to capture that, even though there was food a shelter, life on a train circus was not good either. The Depression was hard on everyone, and no one was left unaffected. So, while there was romanticizing occurring in the novel, it felt as though she was trying to make a fairytale in an unlikely setting. To me, that makes it even more endearing and tender. Many reviews I have read complain that she is trying to push an agenda with some of the issues she tackles, but, to me, this was just a romantic love story of two people finding each other against all odds. I do, however, have to laugh a little at the ending. That part might have been a bit over the top",5,Well Done,1335744000,"04 30, 2012"

A2U1SP48T9BF4X,0002007770,A. Dennis,1,1,"Wow, where to begin. I literally just finished the novel, and was left with the most beautiful feeling of what it means to capture the essence of humanity. Yes! This is something you don't experience too often, and when you do you want to hold onto the feeling and never let go. I'm not going to give a plot summary, or play by play- that's what the product description and other reviews are for. This is a reaction review. I never really wanted to read this novel when it was all the rage. I would walk past it as I scanned the bookshelves, and ignore it on the best-seller list. However, when I saw the 3,000 reviews and all the positive stars mounting up, I knew people must be onto something. That coupled with my Kindle Fire Christmas present, and this is free in the Kindle Lender's Library.Where to start? From the moment you start reading, you are sucked right into Jacob's world, and the world of the circus. You find yourself running alongside Jacob, and taking part of the daily activities of the circus. The characters are highly developed, and you hate, love, and grow with each one of them. The author takes time to even develop the animals which I feel helps readers bond to the very world they now find themselves in.

I was hooked by the time period and the circus idea, and I was looking forward to being drawn into that world, but the author did not deliver on either of those points at all. I felt like she created a pretty shabby structure for her novel by throwing a bunch of ""well researched"" pieces of information together.  She then attempted to flesh in a story around this rickety structure with hollow, card-board, characters.  The voice of young Jacob is meant to carry us through the story of the past, but I felt nothing for him or anyone else in the story. The relationships were so very empty, there were no reasons for anyone to have any connection to anybody else. I was not interested or invested in a single character.  I kept reading in the hope that something would change, but it never did.  It's really too bad when an idea that has such potential turns out be such a disappointment.

It's the first book for a book club my two best friends in NYC and I are starting, and we gave ourselves a month to finish it. Two of us have completed it less than a week after it was assigned.The book tells the story of Jacob, now old, reminiscing about his life as part of a circus. It's an easy read, and no literary feat by any means, but it's a good read all the same. Its 300-plus pages fly by, and in them, you begin to feel like you're a part of the circus, understanding what it's like to work behind the scenes. It discusses the meaning of love, towards both humans and animals, and honour: what do you owe the people around you?The parts I loved best, though, and that touched me the most weren't the love story: I've seen too many of its kind before. No, it was the discussion of aging that got to me and made me cry so hard in the last two pages I woke my boyfriend up: what does it mean to age? What does your family owe you as you age? And what does your life mean when you're ninety-something, in a nursery home, and alone except for your memories? These questions terrify me: they wrack me with guilt and fear, and in raising them, this book became something more than a beach read.

A3UTMPEQ0ENIQ6,0002007770,akhjd,2,3,"This is a fabulous story, written with humor, compassion and profound insight. We are first presented with Jacob Jankowski as an elderly man in a nursing home. The old coot may have problems with his short-term memory, but he certainly has a terrific long-term memory when it comes to remembering the details of his youthful days in a travelling circus. I thought that I had no interest whatsoever in the workings of a depression-era circus, including the care of the exotic animals and the various freaks and acts. However, the author depicts this unique microcosm of humanity with such passion and color that I found myself absolutely absorbed in the story early on.Adding to the historic ambience of this saga are the well-chosen photographs at the start of each chapter: a man with a deformed human growing from his stomach; a woman proudly showing off her bare upper extremities; excited people milling around the big top...It is the undercurrent of spiritual darkness that makes this story fly so high. Gruen depicts the battle between good and evil with stunning accuracy: the greed of Uncle Al; the brutality of August; the surprising kindness of the abandonned dwarf, Walter; and the meek vulnerability of Marlena and her animals.The scene with the drunkard Camel being told that he is dying of poisoning from Jamacai ginger extract is poignant. This, followed by scenes with Camel being cared for in a box car by Walter and Jacob. Stirring, because alternating chapters depict a now elderly Jacob in a similar position of helplessness.In sum, a GREAT book. Whoever thought that an elephant would carry such literary weight?

The story was so intense and the characters were so well developed that I felt like it was one man's life story.  I felt for everyone, even the antagonists, who drove and dominated the other players throughout the story.  Too many times flashback stories cause you to lose pace with the story, but this book drew the reader in so completely that the timeline became seamless.  I really identified with the frailty of youth as much as old age.  It's sad the way that generations place less and less value on the lives of the elderly because of the 'burden' old age creates.  The book helped me understand how, when we age and begin to lose the loved ones of our generation, that some of the resilience that that empowers us is also lost, even though it is not actually gone.  The aged need new sparks to keep the flames of life going and this story brought that ideal out in spectacular fashion.  I have read the book four times since I received it.  For those who love the circus from the inside are in for a shock, unless you have known the hard paces of life and can identify with doing what you need to do to survive because, well, there is nothing better.  I love the camaraderie as much as the separation of classes.  If you know of or lived through the depression, you can identify with much of the goings on when the circus came to town.  In the same vain, you get a sense of why the layout was what it was.  I personally remember the circus from the rubes perspective and can understand from the book much of the production that went into creating the spectacular that kept me enthralled until the next time the circus came to town, never knowing exactly when, just like the book, another adventure at the next jump.",5,Water for Elephants,1305072000,"05 11, 2011"

You don't just visualize the author's words, they leap off the page, and rather than watching the movie in your mind, you are living it. You feel the pain, the joy, the laughter. When the book is finished, you're more than disappointed. You feel invigorated, and you search eagerly through the author's books to see what, along the same vein, she has to offer. You search readers' recommendations to find the books that leave the same imprint on you. Inevitably, though the books satiate your appetite, they don't resonate in the same way. Welcome to Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants.In the prologue, we're privy to a murder. We see it as Jacob sees it, and tries in vain to stop it. Though the victim and murderer aren't named, as we're introduced to them, it becomes clear in our mind who filled those roles.Then we start from the beginning, in the midst of the Great Depression. Jacob is in class, during the final few weeks at Cornell preparing for his finals before he becomes a doctor of veterinary medicine.In a moment, the Dean will enter and change his path. Jacob was to go home and set up shop with his father, working with the animals in his town. Instead, he goes home to identify the remains of his mother and father. He sees the sign his father added to their on-site practice: Jankowitz and Son Veterinary Practice. After identifying his family, he visits the lawyer, who tells him he has nothing. The bank owns the house and everything in it. The explanation as to why his parents mortgaged the house shatters him. He returns to school to finish his finals and finds that he can't.Jacob flees and seeing a train pass, tries to jump aboard. Once on, he realizes it is a circus train. An old man, Camel, vouches for him and works to get him a job within.As soon as the boss finds he is Ivy League educated, degree or no degree, he becomes the animal man. With such a prestigious job within, he straddles the division between the higher ups and performers, and the lower echelon who helped secure his place.One performer in particular, Marlena, fascinates him. She reminds him physically of the girl he left behind at school, and emotionally captivates him. She matches his love of animals. Married to August, who has the boss' ear, she is off-limits, but a friendship develops anyway.Later comes Rosie, an elephant pilfered from a circus that has gone defunct. Rosie suffers August's wrath many, many times. Jacob is stunned by her human like qualities. Understanding, pain, anger, empathy, happiness all emanate from her big brown eyes.Following the story, I felt all of the emotions Rosie feels (except perhaps, the pain). Astonishment at the goings on to keep the circus running smoothly. The love Jacob develops for many people who help him in the course of creating a new life for himself, free of the memories surrounding his past. Sadness at the loss of animals, anger at the treatment of the animals and the red lighting of, as they're called today, carnies.The characters came alive to me, as did the setting. As soon as I finished this book, I eagerly went to Sara Gruen's website to read excerpts of other novels she had written. While good, they didn't capture me the way this did. And I wanted more of this. So I went to Amazon's recommendations Disappointedly, I moved on to Barnes and Noble. No dice. So I tried the next best thing. Research. I wanted to read first hand accounts of the circus the way it was back then. The more I read, the more I craved.Then, as though they knew my hunger, work offered me discounted tickets to the circus. I'm still debating. On the one hand, it's the circus. Elephants that feel things like people do! Horses that synchronize! How can I say no? On the other hand, it's not the 1920s. It's almost 100 years later. What if it's not the same? I mean true, we're in the middle of a depression (point 4 of pros: It's almost the same!). But people are categorically different than they were then. Theoretically, this extends to performers as well right?But alas, I have chosen to forego the circus at this moment, because I fear, like the recommendations of Barnes and Noble and Amazon, it may fall short. So I will hold onto the satisfaction this book gave me, and the hunger for more of the same. Hopefully, there will be another book that catches my attention like this one.

I aked him what prompted him to chose it - he said because I've had a life long fascination with Freak Shows and they're part of the Circus. OK. Fair enough.If it hadn't been for him buying it for me I would have missed out on what has become my favorite piece of fiction I have ever read.I am in love with this book.This book is enchanting. The characters are, variously, loveable, hateworthy, pathetic, nasty and dastardly.Sara Gruen knows her characters so well and writes them with such passion they seem real. You will feel that you know them too. And the writing is so vivid you will feel like you're standing ring-side. Inhale deeply - can you smell the cotton candy?And the ending of this book is the most perfect, satisfying ending I have ever, ever read.I'm not going to pigeon-hole it with category or genre and risk putting some people off...like me.There are some Book Club talking points at the end of the paperback version and one such talking point is to discuss the book's 'pathetic glamour.' That is a perfect descriptor. The circus fakes its glamour and its glitz; the daily lives of the crews who work it are anything but, and at times are brutal, harrowing, even.I've learned a valuable lesson from this book - what I want as a reader is just writing that takes my breath away. I got that from WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.",5,Enchanting,1297641600,"02 14, 2011"
A3NQA5HYANTPU1,0002007770,Alexis,0,0,"The book Water for Elephants tells the adventurous tale of Jacob Jankowski and his life in a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jankowski is an orphaned 23 year old veterinary student at Cornell who leaves school before taking his final exams, only to end up jumping a train. Little does he know this train is that of a circus where he is immediately put to work. Over the next few months, he encounters the ""behind the scene"" life of a circus. Jacob experiences the wonders of love and the pain of a corrupt business.The story is told by the elderly Jacob, who is currently living in an assisted living home, where he is constantly reminded of the inevitable process of growing old. ""Joy surges through me when I realize that not only do I remember where I am and who she is but also that it's circus day."" The memories of life in the circus come rushing back to him when a circus comes to town, setting up right across the street from his building. Jacob isn't just remembering; he is reliving his life during the depression as a veterinarian for the circus. The young Jacob is a confused drop-out who is taken in by a worker in a ""wannabe"" Ringling Brothers circus. He doesn't know what he wants to do with his life now that he hasn't passed his exams to be a veterinarian, but he is useful for helping with the circus animals. Here he meets Marlena, a beautiful performer who works with the horses. She and Jacob form a bond over their shared love and care of animals. Her husband, and Jacob's boss, is a controlling character who sometimes lashes out due to his paranoia. Jacob is stuck with an angry dwarf and his dog Queenie as roommates, but later befriends him. Possibly the most influential character is Rosie, a sweet and innocent elephant, who changes everyone's lives forever on one fateful day.  And last, there is the leader of the circus, Uncle Al. He is a powerful and power-hungry man who craves to be better than the competition. But when Jacob has had enough of the corruption and dishonesty that he witnesses, it is up to him and his new friends to help save those in danger.This book is an adventurous and comical story for adults; it keeps the story going until the very end. I found that I was brought into a world that most people never experience. I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking not only a fun story, but an intriguing story about finding one's place in the world. I personally feel Sara Gruen created a wonderful book that tells the story of wild adventure and finding yourself along the way.

It also has an added dimension: the story is told by the hero as he resides in a nursing home, and suffers from the condescending  attitudes toward the patients there.

Hamilton,0,0,"Book DescriptionAs a young man, Jacob Jankowski was tossed by Fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm.

My biggest beef with this book is the quality of writing, and I always wonder how books like this make the best seller's list. I found the dialogue was not only thin, but so obviously written by a woman that it was impossible to believe in the male narration.  It would also have been more believable if the author had vaguely attempted to match the dialogue to the era in which the story took place (did they really say f**k that much back then?) The copy I had was from our local library, and on one page the statement ""...Whatever"", as in 'big deal', had been circled in pencil with the comment (in an old person's handwriting) ""not from the '30's""--that rather summed it up.  I got tired of the cheesy descriptions of sex and violence -- believe me, the human imagination is very capable, and less is more in these areas in the hands of a capable writer. Particularly in the case of masturbating dwarves...The characters could have been more richly drawn, the plot less predictable, considering the setting.I admit that I'm reading this on the heels of the marvelously written 'The Road', by Cormac McCarthy--the comparison is glaring.",1,I Want My 4 Hours Back...,1207872000,"04 11, 2008"

Although the author says in her remarks that there was an interruption during her writing of the book, the storyline is about as streamlined as it could be.

It was everything you could possibly want in a book including: drama (lots of it), love, revenge, and lust. It was emotional and wrenching.  I was literally hanging on every word in the book. I actually have already watched the movie, so while reading I was imagining the movie in my head and both of them left me wanting more. You know how when you watch a movie and it was great, but when you read the book it isn't the same, or even vice versa, well that was not the case with this. Both kept bringing you back for more in every chapter and in every scene. It is obvious Sara Gruen knew what ingredients to put in this book, she took care into every chapter and it paid off. According to Gruen from an interview included in the back of the book many of the anecdotes in the story were based upon real events culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers. As a result, ""Water for Elephants"" is a novel that both entertains, and informs that there are secrets behind all doors, or should I say big tops. It starts off with the 93- year old Jacob in a nursing home where he is limited to what he can do and may forget his age, ""I'm ninety or ninety-three. One or the other."" But never the stories that make his cloudy days become the brightest days ever. It is the story of his incredible life and adventures with the Benzini Brothers circus, and his memory serves to unfold his life's tale that is equally both humorous and emotionally wrenching.  All the characters-whether minor or major-play an unforgettable role, even the animals are given characters that make them a pivotal part of the story.

However, after having to force myself to finish the book, I am left with feeling utterly unimpressed and wishing I had spent my time doing menial house chores instead.First, the characters were one-dimensional. They frequently did things that were out of character (why would a jealous man keep inviting his ""competition"" on dates with he and his wife??), we don't know any background information or history of characters, and are left feeling completely disconnected and emotionally distant. They are all cliche stock characters.Second, the love story is written atrociously. We are expected to just accept that two characters fall in love when they've barely had the chance to exchange ten words with each other. We are expected to accept a ""love at first sight"" situation here, but I feel like that is just lazy writing. There are two scenes later where they finally have a moment of emotional connection, but the development of their love is noticeably absent, which left me not really caring for the rest of the book about their relationship because it felt so fake and superficial.Third, there are random, unnecessary sex scenes. I will give anyone 20 dollars who can find 10 pages in a row that doesn't mention an erection, male genitalia, two random strangers in the background having sex, or breasts. I will admit that a well placed love scene can add to the progression of a story. But this was filled with so many explicit descriptions it was just plain tasteless.Overall, it is just bad writing with terrible story and character development, which is too bad, because the basic story itself could have been very intriguing and brought to light a lot about the history of America during the depression. I wish this had been written by a better author who knows how to write well.

When he returns home to bury them, he learns that his father is bankrupt and all he inherits is debts. After the funeral he returns to Cornell where his room and board have been paid up until the end of the year. He tries to sit for his final exams but ends up leaving without answering a single question. He walks away from the college and finally jumps aboard a railroad car and begins what will be an unusual life, a hard life, and exciting life with a circus.The story is told by Jacob when he is an old man living in a rest home. It is a depiction of life during the hard years of the Great Depression, the even harder life as a member of a traveling circus, and also provides a peek into the life of early rest homes.I found the book to be a little raw in spots but also exciting and entertaining because I remember the traveling circuses with the big top tents and the intriguing side shows which, as a child, I was never allowed to see.

I enjoyed the visual scenes that Gruen painted and could easily picture it. I just couldn't get past the story.  I didn't feel an immediate chemistry between Jacob and Marlena. I'm sorry if most other people disagree with me, but the 'heat' just wasn't truly there for me. At times I almost felt that Jacob only attracted Marlena due to his difference to August, not due to the actual love between them. While I also enjoyed the perspective of Jacob as an old man remembering his story, it really just left me sad whenever I read scenes from the older Jacob's perspective. He seemed so unhappy and it made me feel as if I were reading two stories, one with a happy ending and one with a sad ending. In all, I gave this story 3 stars because I felt that perhaps if it wasn't being sold as a love story I would have appreciated it more. Instead I am left wondering what was so noteworthy about the characters love beyond the fact that they supposedly found love while working on a circus.",3,Not understanding the hype,1296604800,"02 2, 2011"

A196KFU4W81IOV,0002007770,"Always Reading ""Picky Me""",2,4,"There are books you read for the story, and books you read for the writing.  Water for Elephants is of the former variety.  It's a quick read and a good read, but it is not a great book.Ms. Gruen was thorough in her research, so the reader does get some feeling for the gritty world of the ""train circus"", yet I felt when I finished the book that I had no clear sense of who the characters were.  Jacob is a nebulous character as a young man, and a shallow one in old age.  As for the rest of the ""cast"", well, when they are good they are very very good, and when they are bad they are...monsters.  Rosie the elephant is one of the more developed characters!The author doesn't seem to have a good ear for speech, either.  Any of the book's dialog could come from any character's mouth, for the most part, and some of the things Jacob says (or says in his mind) as an old man seem to land with a clunk.  They just don't fit.Add to that a slightly corny ending and a structure that comes out of any pulp murder mystery (old person recalling a murder, then going back to the start of the story and working back up to the murder...with a twist), and you get just a middling-good book.I am vehemently against the use (abuse) of animals in circuses, so I was happy to see that animal abuse was part of this story.  In fact, I think the author cleaned it up a bit too much (few facts about the orangutan and the chimpanzee, for instance..it's sickening what the higher apes were subject to, and still are).  What I think she could have cut back on is the gratuitous details about sex and the cooch tent.  That all seemed tacked on and unnessesary.Overall, I consider this book worth reading, but I don't see what all the excitement is about.  If you really want a feeling for circus sideshow life, read the novel Geek Love.",3,"Good story, average writing.",1182729600,"06 25, 2007"

A gentleman who is in his frail state of 93 years old reflects back on his earlier years. As a young man, he had just faced a horrific tragedy in his family, was left with nothing, and so ran off only to find himself working in the circus. And what an eye-opening and life-changing experience that was. From the greedy circus owner, Uncle Al, the dangerous August and his lovely wife, Marlena--the plot just kept on thickening. And the added touch of the animals--especially the charming elephant, Rosie--simply made the story line all the more entertaining.I was stubborn for so long, not reading this. I think of myself as a tough audience as I bore easily. But wow-o-wow--WHAT a book! It took about getting two thirds through until I simply couldn't put it down. And bravo to the author for the tremendous amount of detailed research she did. It is quite apparent. I felt like I was truly getting a taste of the Great Depression and a look at the circus life of that time period. My only annoyance was finishing a chapter packed full of suspense, turning the page, only to find myself back in the nursing home with the old man. I think that is just my impatience speaking, though, because in the end the author did a brilliant job of intertwining the past and present--to the point that I got choked up and almost shed a tear (I said almost).So, in short, read this book!

It tells about how he came about working for the circus, the relationships he formed and what went on behind the scenes of a circus.  Looking back, Jacob compares his  present life in a ""retirement home"" with his time on the road with the circus.

Having finished, I'm mystified about the huge number of five-star reviews.I don't know much about circuses so I can't comment on the quality of the author's research efforts, although I see other reviewers have pointed out shortcomings. What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It's never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn't tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own ""love"" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don't want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that I strongly believe that Jacob, the narrator and main character, absolutely positively does NOT deserve the long and largely happy life he'll eventually get to lead. It's one thing to care about animals and less fortunate humans. That test, Jacob passes with flying colors. But when it comes to moderating one's own urges and balancing them against the well-being of others (all others close to you, not just Marlena, the love interest), Jacob gets a huge F-.",1,Overrated - Shallow characters,1336867200,"05 13, 2012"

Don't get me wrong, I found most of it entertaining, but I think the story lacked in its development, and I never figured out why religion was ever even brought up among the characters in the earlier part of the book, when it apparently had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also a bit of a let-down because it was just too ""happily ever after"" for me.The funny thing is that I'm not a big fan of Circuses in general, but surprisingly, I found the source material to be rather fascinating,  So, if anything, this book will propel me to look into more historical reading material on Circuses from the 19th century to the turn of the 20th Century.",3,Expected more.,1276560000,"06 15, 2010"

A1TP7S015RG02P,0002007770,Amazon Customer,0,0,"I found ""Water for Elephants"" extremely entertaining, despite never seeing a circus or having any interest in the subject.  The backdrop is the 1930's, and the book throws you into the era of carnivals, Prohibition, and the Great Depression.  You're led by slums with hobos, and everyone is dying for regular pay and something to eat.The story bounces back and forth between a man living out his twilight years in a nursing home, and his 23-year-old self... where circumstances find him joining a circus.  Life revolves around the train for these guys - they always travel in cramped space with all kinds of memorable characters.There are some great anecdotes so strange you'd think they were true.  My favorite was Rosie the bull elephant sneaking lemonade by pulling her stake out of the ground, and then being smart enough to replace it to avoid getting caught.The author respects the reader enough to let him figure out what's happening from contextual clues.  For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed.  You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz).  Note that there are some graphic sexual encounters and profanity that make this mature with a capital ""M"" - don't give it to anyone younger than a high school kid.",5,authentic & memorable,1204070400,"02 27, 2008"

I am especially looking forward to seeing the movie now that recently came out.I liked how the story flipped from present-day Jacob who was 93 years old in a nursing home to the story of young Jacob on the circus train. The first part of the story of the events leading to how Jacob comes to join the circus in the first place really get the story going and draw the reader's interest. There is a fair amount of sexual content within the story that surprised me a little but was in keeping with the progression of the story.

A1952JDCMXZRC9,0002007770,Amazon Customer,0,0,"Water for Elephants is a tough one for me to review. I loved the theme and the split realities of it. You are basically following Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, through two of his life's biggest adventures. We are introduced to him at the circus and follow his story of how he becomes a vet for the Benzini Brother's traveling circus. We are also switching back into his current reality where he is re-living these days from the nursing home that he now resides in.There are good plot points throughout, and I did find myself wanting to get back to the book to see what happens next. At times, however, I found certain events did not play out in a way that was realistic to the story that was being built. Even though I was enjoying the story and the narrative - I found myself aware of the fact that there was an author behind it all, pulling the strings. Not being able to quite put my finger on why, I was often pulled out of believing the story, almost as if the author was showing too many fingerprints of the process of writing. For this reason - it was hard for me to get lost completely in the book itself.All of that aside, however, I still found it beautiful. There was a moment in particular when I felt incredibly sad for our main character - to the point where I had to put the book down and step away for a moment to collect myself. There is a wonderfully commentary woven throughout that allows the reader to ponder where one is at when you are looking back at your life in old age. I really enjoyed that thread.I had heard a lot of really good things about the book, and was going into it that way. Unfortunately, there was something missing for me when I completed it, almost as if I had skipped an important part.

A19D3N662QS9WD,0002007770,Amazon Customer,0,0,"Water for Elephants is first narrated by Jacob, a 90-93 year old living out his days in a nursing home. He begins to tell the story of his life including a 70 (or so) year old secret he's revealing to anyone for the first time. Jacob is a young man just short of taking his tests to become a Veterinarian until both his parents die, and his life seems to hold no direction. He accidently finds himself in the midst of circus train where he meets an unpredictable circus manager, August, his beautiful wife, Marlena, and later a difficult to train elephant, Rosie.The element that lights up this audio book is John Randolph Jones amazing narration as the tired and cantankerous older Jacob. His voice is heavy with age and experience. It would be difficult for any secondary narrator to compete but David LeDoux does a good job of holding his own. Though the setting is lively and obviously well researched, the love triangle is underdeveloped and the end of the book just sort of unravels.

A1RMIULDD6LFV0,0002007770,Amazon Customer,0,1,"This book was just so-so for me.  There was a total disconnect for me with any of the characters specifically between Jacob and Marlena.  I thought their love story lacked passion of any kind.  For me, it felt like the only thing keeping them together was the horses and later Rosie.  It wasn't until half way through the book when Jacob finally admits he's in love with her and it's so lackluster I didn't really believe it.  Perhaps I feel this way because I had just finished reading ""Wurthering Heights"" before this and expecting more passion between the young lovers; however I'm not interested in reading this book again to find out if that's true.......which is saying a lot.  I thought the most interesting part of the book was the Q&A portion at the end where Gruen talks about her research and how all the events that took place on and off the train were based on real events that happened to various circus's during that time.  Knowing that did kind of put those events into prospective, but not really being interested in circus history is where it failed to capture me.  In the end: Big on Circus history, lacking on the love story.

Jacob is a wonderful main character who is thrust into a world, grieving and desolate after his parents sudden death leaves him with nothing. The story is told by him as an old man of 90 or 93 as he says and is truly blunt on how our elders are treated in nursing homes and devalued as human beings. But, the wonderful, painful and thrilling story of his life, his love and his journey after his parents death lands him in a circus is spellbinding.Just know that the ending will make you smile and cry and feel joy for Jacob!",5,what a wonderful story!,1381017600,"10 6, 2013"

I know it's a long way from really collecting valuable books but this will be MY collection of MY favorite books. I just retired from my nursing career and now spend time quilting and reading. I'm telling you...It's the life....! It was delivered quickly and in perfect condition with lots of protection and photos and signatures and interesting info.

The book is wonderfully written, and the reader can easily stay engaged in the story. However, the descriptions of the violence, particularly that toward the animals, was too much for me. I have no tolerance for cruelty toward animals, and it was incredibly difficult for me to get through these parts of the story. Yes, it helped that so many of the characters were compassionate and morally sound people, but I still cringe at the thought of the way poor Rosie was sometimes treated.On a side note, the movie was very similar to the book - a bit truncated, as it would have to be. But, other than the animal cruelty, I really enjoyed both the book and the movie.

AQXXALB466WE7,0002007770,Amazon Customer,1,1,"I have a tendency of sticking with supernatural stories because I love the magic of them. While ""Water for Elephants"" is far from supernatural, this story was easily the definition of magical.The story actually starts out in the nursing home, which is so intricately described that I could hear the whirring of the mechanical machines; helping the patients stay alive, and I could smell the putrid scent of finality in the air. Instantly I was pulled in by the lyrical writing style. The author also does a nice job of analyzing life's major questions, and hopping on her train of thought was enjoyable.The unwinding of Jacob's memories is done so beautifully. Gruen achieved what few authors can and brought her characters to life. I almost felt like I was hearing this beautiful, heartbreaking, brave and wonderful story first hand, staring at Jacob's frail body beneath the fluorescent lights of the nursing home.This book took me on a journey, and at the end I wasn't quite ready to hop off the train. There was a twist I never saw coming, and my only regret is it took me so long to pick this one up and read it.

A1SO5AN8PRB37E,0002007770,Amazon Customer,1,1,"I loved the rich, descriptive language. The author does a great job of the writer's maxim ""show, don't tell,"" revealing bits and pieces to fill in the details and background of characters over time. The main character, Jacob, is very funny, especially when he's a 93-year old with attitude. I felt so sorry for old Jacob after a while. I really wanted to get back to young Jacob and hoped for a happy ending. Without giving anything away, I was incensed at one point about what happened to old Jacob. I hated that part so much that I questioned all the favorable reviews. However, I must say that I'm satisfied with the ending and glad that I read the book. One bonus of the fact that it's a best seller: I was able to easily check this out from my local library after a few week's wait. No problem, I wasn't in a hurry.Regarding adult themes (beware potential SPOILERS below):I'm definitely NOT a fan of inserting graphic sex or nudity or swearing into a story for no reason. I prefer nice clean stories and think you really don't need to be explicit. However, I think the scenes in this story helped set the environment. They were typically treated with such humor that I laughed a lot and didn't mind them. First, young virgin Jacob guards a stripper while she performs. The striptease and gigantic breasts are described in vivid detail. Jacob's horror, amazement, and embarassment, having never seen a naked woman before shows he's really not in Kansas any more. That's the most explicit scene and it's really hilarious. There are a few other sexual situations, often mixed with drinking. The actual love making was left to the imagination. There's a little swearing. I found the beating of animals to be the most objectionable; Jacob, the animal lover, spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to help.",5,Rich Characters; Beware of Adult Themes,1318377600,"10 12, 2011"

I saw the movie first, then read the book, then saw the movie again. As often happens, the book provides much more color than the movie ever could. For instance, the owner of the circus, Big Al, is shown in the movie in only one scene for a moment giving approval for a purchase.  Sara researched the subject of &#34;train circuses&#34; in detail.  The cruel practices common during the depression to stay in business are shocking, but make riveting reading as the backdrop for this story of growing up, awakening, and goal-seeking.

Sarah Gruen did a great job of telling the story ofcircus with all the beauty, cruelty and the harsh life during the depression.The author states that she did research the circus during that time period and it shows in her writing.  She really describes the  people and animals that were the main part of a circus and they  come to life in my mind. I could see and hear them as I read the book.It starts off with the main character, Jacob Jankowski as a very angry oldman in a nursing home. He decides to go to the circus and reminisces about his past. We are then introduced to the young Jacob Jankowski. The book goes back and forth in time as many do today.The author really nails it when she writes about the depression. I have read and studied the depression and she portrayes it so vividly. I felt so sorry for the workers, performers and the animals. They all suffered in one way or another.The characters had their flaws.The book paints the Ringleader as a charming but violent man. One who had a short fuse and was a loose cannon.I was fascinated by Jacob Jankowski. In spite of the hardships that he had to endure,his kindness and gentleness never wavered.I admired Marlena as a beautiful, graceful and long-suffering woman. She was  not brave enough to leave.

For starters, the ""old man reflecting from a retirement home"" is a tired technique and all those chapters bored me to tears. My main problem with the novel, however, is that the characters are one dimensional.  They always seem to be doing dramatic things and facing tragedy after tragedy, but I couldn't connect because there is very little reflection or internal monologue (not even in the retirement home!).  The story clips along at such a quick pace it gets bogged down by its own far-fetched events.  I found it difficult to understand why the characters, and even Rosie the elephant, act the way they do--everything seems trumped up to make the plot work. I can't say I even completely understand the title.  I got the connection to the man in the retirement home who claimed he carried water for elephants, but what in the heck did this have to do with the story?

The sad and tragic day when his own kids forgot to come take him to the circus is what so many elderly must experience each and every day.  Ms. Gruen was able to capture the story of circuses during the depression.  But for me, she touched my heat and soul with the story of older Jacob.",5,The age of the aged.,1208217600,"04 15, 2008"

Sara Gruen demonstrates a gift for characterization.  Each character transcends his/her strengths and weaknesses to portray the good, the bad and the ugly of circus life in the post-depression era.  She truly captured the mystique of ""running away to join the circus"" through her characterization.Jacob Jankowski's (the narrator & featured characher) sense of humor is priceless.  I found myself either chuckling out loud or squirming in disgust throughout his storytelling.I found the book difficult to put down; yet, I did not want it to end.If you don't read another book this summer, read this one.

A2L4XHGKHD9BYK,0002007770,A. Meikle,4,5,"Sara Gruen couldn't be more different than the character she writes in the first person.  Jacob is ninety (or it is ninety-three) and, in his reminiscences about his time on a depression era circus train, he is in his early twenties. Through Jacob, we learn of the plight of the circus animals--the ""hay burners"", the cats and ultimately Rosie, the elephant--from the perspective of their vet.  He tells us also of the performers and roustabouts on the circus as he builds friendships, cares for the animals, and falls in love.  The story moves at the pace of a circus--and sometimes, at the pace of the train that moves the circus from town-to-town!  At intervals, we are reminded that Jacob is now in his nineties, frail and living in a retirement home--but the life he relives in his head is that of the circus vet.Jacob's tale is at times heart-warming and at times heart-rending; but always exciting, and believable.  That makes it earthy and gritty and sometimes not for the faint of heart--however, I found it immensely rewarding in the end and recommend it heartily.  It will especially appeal to those amongst us who are incurably romantic or once dreamed of running away to join the circus.",5,Run Away to the Circus,1159574400,"09 30, 2006"

He still has his wits about him and although his body is failing him, his memory is not.  He recounts a tragedy that was the catalyst for his adventure into the circus life.  He comes across all manners of freakish characters and animals and ends up falling in love along the way.  The book is as much an homage to his younger life as it is an homage to the circus.

I thought it was going to be some horrible account of the circus life and have no substance. Boy was I wrong. The protagonist Jacob leaves his exams to become a vet after learning of the death of his parents and literally jumps aboard a train not knowing what kind of train it is or the kind of people on it.

A1DM8V4DDNKRK7,0002007770,"Andrew Corsa ""Reader""",0,1,"I agree with many of this book's reviews.  They're right; the author does make you empathize with her characters.  When reading, I felt like I was right with the characters, watching them.  Many reviewers also emphasize and appreciate the book's unusual story.  The story really does have wonderful historical flavor.  Most of the characters participate in a 1930s traveling circus, and reading about this circus-society is entertaining and informative.Now, for all of that, the book's writing was nothing extraordinary.  While Sara Gruen tells a unique story, she is not a unique storyteller.  Her writing was too common for me, too similar to the writing styles of so many authors who are currently alive.As I was reading, I kept asking myself, ""Have I read anything by this author before?""  The truth was, I had never read anything else by her.  But I felt like I had, because her writing style and word choices were nothing new to me.I imagine that, in a couple years, I won't be able to remember reading this book.  Perhaps I'll hear someone talk about it, and I'll get a feeling of deja-vu and say, ""Oh yeah.  I think I might have read something like that, at some point.""Again, don't get me wrong; this was an engaging book.  It was entertaining, and I cared about the characters.  It was a good read, and well worth my time.  I happily recommend it to people who want to be entertained, and who might like to read about the circus.  Just don't expect anything amazing.Oh, and if you don't like violence or scenes with sexual content, you should probably stay away.

During this time, he falls in love with Marlena, who is a performer in the show and also married to the ringleader.I will say that Gruen is gifted in her ability to create imagery.  You can see the animals and feel the angst that the circus employees go through under their sadistic leaders.  That being said, I can't say that Marlena is a well-developed character.  I don't feel as though we know why Jacob fell in love with her, beyond the fact that she was beautiful and cared about her animals.

Then it struck me that I was strongly remindedof Stephen King's ""The Green Mile"" when I read the old Jacob sections (very old man in an old person's home reminiscing about anoddly sentient animal while struggling to retain his identity in the face of unsympathetic caregivers). There's even the Popeye/Olive Oyl8-pager which is also referenced in ""The Green Mile"".  The Jacob/Marlena/August triangle was similar to the onein William Styron's ""Sophie's Choice"" (volatile charming Jewish man with a personality  disorder married to a younger sensitive woman, theyoung man taken under the older man's wing falling in love with the wife, resulting in violence and upheaval).But beyond that, the Jacob/Marlena love story was very poorly developed. Marlena never came together as a three-dimensionalcharacter.  When older Jacob talks about his wife and how she was his helpmeet at the beginning of the book, a weak, passive character such as Marlena was not the woman I pictured. I certainly don't understand why he fell so deeply in love with her. The ending was feel-good but nevertheless unsatisfying due to its lack of realism.The few plus points in this book are the quirky secondary characters such as Walter and Camel. The thematic setting of a traveling circus was also interesting but after reading the author interview included with the Kindle version, it seems a lot of the side plots and atmospheric color were lifted largely unaltered from actual instances the author read or heard about while researching the book.Given the hype, I didn't expect a book that I will barely remember in another month except for its similarity to other, better works.",2,Disappointing and derivative,1324339200,"12 20, 2011"

A3Q1XFBVHPW7WF,0002007770,"Anna ""Caro""",0,0,"While the story outline seemed really fascinating, I was very soon disappointed with how monotonous the narrative developed.The synopsis could read: A young (almost) veterinarian faces series of tragic situations and ends up joining an itinerant circus as a result of these. The main character, young Jacob Jankowski, is innocent, charming and caring and it was very hard to relate his traits with the 93-year old Jacob that is telling the story in retrospect. The two sides of the character seem like two different people and an explanation for this change in personality is nowhere to be found. In general it seems difficult to relate to the characters in the book. All seem somewhat flat and develop in the same way: all are portrayed stereotypically, but then have an added (good/bad) layer. For example, August is a mean and violent man, but occasionally can be charming. Walter is grumpy and hurtful, but then turns out to be also protective, etc.The story increases in pace after the elephant joints the circus (roughly at the middle of the book) and it does get more enjoyable to read. Maybe also because the character of the elephant is probably the one that is best accomplished of all the characters in the book.Overall, the descriptions of the circus in the time of depression and prohibition in the US are engaging and the story is (especially in its second half) entertaining, but it is not a book that stands out.",3,Interesting story that does not exploit its full potential,1401580800,"06 1, 2014"

The novel is not nearly as imaginative as you would believe, given the premise of the story itself.  Aside from the circus setting, this is a very conventional book story-wise.  Which isn't necessarily a problem, except that the author attempts to stretch the story beyond what it is, often falling way too in love with her writing and going on for long, descriptive asides that lead nowhere.  Ultimately, the story is tied together by a very abrupt and rushed ending.  Just very unsatisfying.

I won't go into the plot because other reviewers have done it, and done it well. Suffice it to say, this book had me in its clutches from beginning to end, and the story has stayed with me ever since that last page was turned. In addition to Rosie (the most endearing elephant this side of Horton and Dumbo), Gruen's circus characters grab hold of you and refuse to let go. I was particularly enamored of Kinko/Walter and the way his relationship with Jacob developed over the course of this compelling story.The writing is rich and fulfilling, full of texture. This novel will engage all your senses. You will see the big top and hear the guys pounding in the stakes. You will smell the animals, the aroma of fresh sawdust and breakfast cooking. And you will feel the same pleasure and pain the characters feel as they take your hand and lead you into the world of a Depression era circus.As for how Gruen, a young woman, managed to get herself into the head of a 93-year-old man?

All those he cared about during his circus days: Marlena the bare-back rider, Rosie the elephant, Camel the roustabout, Walter the dwarf and Bobo the orangutan are dead now, but they glow with life in Jacob's memory.  It's true his memories are not always pleasant. His years with the circus were depression years for the country, with circuses failing on all sides. If you read this book you'll see a side of the circus you probably never imagined: its rigid caste system of performers vs working men, skipped paychecks, long days and longer nights, jealousy, madness and death.

A14HH6394458VI,0002007770,Anne S.,1,3,"I have to agree with a lot of the mediocre and low star reviews. As many have said, it is a very interesting subject, but it could have been done much better.  I'll preface this by saying that I hardly ever read contemporary fiction, so perhaps I'm just not used to the modern style of writing.  Most fiction I read is from the era when a book could not be published if there was too much ""obscenity"" or if it was too graphic.Nonetheless, here's where I felt this novel fell short:As others have noted, it felt too contemporary.  Some of the language didn't seem to fit the times. I know the ""f"" word and other swearing has been around forever, but I almost never hear people from that generation use it. Also, young Jake laments being a virgin so much, but from talking with people who came of age before the sexual revolution, it was pretty much expected that one would remain that way until marriage. Even Hugh Hefner was a virgin until his mid 20s.The character of Jake was not convincing. I didn't get a good sense of who he really was as a young man, and the young Jake and the old Jake could have been two different people as far as I could tell.I didn't find the old Jake to be very symphathetic.  I felt bad for him for being trapped in a nursing home, but he gave the nurses a hard time and picked fights with another male resident which canceled out a lot of sympathy I would have had for him.  Also, I had trouble with Jake's situation.  If he couldn't even remember his family members who came to visit or the names of the nurses who took care of him, how come he could always remember the names and details of his fellow residents with no problem?A lot of reviewers had trouble reading the scenes about animal cruelty. I love animals, but I didn't have that much trouble reading them because I wasn't really convinced by the writing.As many others have said, the ending is unrealistic. Some people may not be bothered by this, but that's one thing that irks me.On the positive side, it was entertaining.

He becomes the show's vet and befriends monkeys, tigers, horses, and one oppressed but ultimately triumphant elephant.Sara Gruen is a master of plot, building to a suspenseful climax and weaving together her storylines with tidbits and gems from her research on American circuses.

A3BIWTN2DA0YY2,0002007770,Antoinette Klein,17,20,"Sara Gruen has penned a most enjoyable book about life in the circus.  The story unfolds in two time frames from the first-person point of view of Jacob Jankowski.  As a twenty-three year old vet traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth and as a ninety-three year old man confined to an assisted living facility and repulsed by the sight of his aging body, his ever-sharp mind moves us effortlessly between the two time periods.  We are told he is about to reveal a secret he has kept hidden for seventy years----and what a story it is!In 1931, a tragic accident takes his parents from him and leaves him alone and penniless in the midst of the Great Depression.  The circus is both his salvation and his personal hell as he signs on to care for the animals.  Jacob and the characters he encounters are drawn so vividly that you will remember them long after the last page is read:  Marlena, the pink-sequined star of the equestrian act; her mercurial husband August who suffers with bouts of paranoid schizophrenia; Walter, the dwarf whose mother sold him to the circus, and Camel, the first member of the circus to befriend Jacob will all make you laugh and cry and cry again.  But it is Rosie, the lemonade-stealing elephant, who will steal a piece of your heart and cause you never to look at elephants in quite the same way again.Heartbreaking, poignant, and with a double surprise of an ending, this amazing plot unfolds with actual circus stories the author tells us in her end note that she has taken from real life.  Peppered with antique photos of long-ago circuses, this is an amazing book not only of circus life but of a man coming to grips with his diminished capacity and the aging flesh surrounding his ever-young heart.

The story is narrated by Jacob Jankowski, well the 93 year old version and the 23 year old version. The young Jankowski joined a traveling circus in depression-era America after the sudden death of his parents. With his veterinary background, Jacob is put in charge of the filthy, underfed and sometimes abused animals. The Benzini Bros. traveling circus is everything one would imagine a circus to be-dirty, crazy, and full of all kinds of different folks. Workers are apt to disappear in the night (thrown from the train, no longer able to be paid). It is obvious that Gruen did her homework on traveling circuses. Her terminology is spot-on and her vivid description is exquisite. The stand out characters are August the animal trainer, Marlena (his wife and a performer in the circus), and of course Rosie, the elephant. Gruen weaves together a story that is at times hilarious, heartwrenching, touching, warm, sad and so moving. The ending is perfect, and I could not have asked for a more enjoyable read.",5,Heartwarming Read,1318896000,"10 18, 2011"

I thought this book was sure to deliver heroic tales of Jacob saving circus animals from illness, injury & emotional harm that surely would be inflicted on these poor animals...which it is...but does Jacob do anything about it? NOT REALLY! It seems that Jacob never finds it in himself to take some action when you would be expecting it! Instead the author decided to predicate this book on a contrived love story that didn't move me at all. I barely felt the chemistry between Jacob and Marlena and I generally found Jacob's character so shallow and boring that I couldn't even finish the book.

A21NVBFIEQWDSG,0002007770,Armchair Interviews,2,3,"Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is one of those rare novels that will be read and re-read, discussed and enjoyed for many years, by old and young alike. Destined to be passed among family and friends and back again, until the tattered, timeworn pages resemble the books beloved central character and narrator.Jacob Jankowski had studied Veterinary Medicine and was days from exams when his parents were killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, he hopped a train, never intending to ""run away with the circus"".... It was the midst of the depression and life was hard. Joining the Benzini Brothers Circus would change his life again. From town to town, day after day, set it up, tear it down-the freaks and geeks, midgets and clowns worked, ate, lived and often died together. The harsh conditions are made even more unbearable by the greedy manager and his insane animal trainer. Yet somehow, in the midst of despair, friendships and laughter persevered. Although much of the laughter was alcohol induced, during the height of the depression and prohibition, you took what you could get.The narrator's transition from the young circus vet, to the elderly, cantankerous nursing home resident, is a well-crafted, bi-lateral view that pulls the reader into this fictional world and never lets go. Whether in his twenties, admiring the beautiful equestrian performer, Marlena, and caring for the animals he loved-or in his nineties, complaining about the indignities of old age, the warm, quick wit comes through loud and clear. From the big top to the nursing facility Gruen's sharp, three-dimensional, fictionally fluid characters will have you laughing out loud one minute, mouth agape in disgust the next.Hurry, hurry, step right up, readers and book lovers everywhere. If you hunger for a reading experience chock full of every conceivable emotion, beautifully written and wholly engrossing, Water for Elephants is a wondrous world, where fact and fiction combine, delivering the most memorable and pleasurable hours, you will be spend with a book. Characters so sharply drawn and wrought with emotion that there nearly flow off the page.Armchair Interviews says: If you only read one book this summer, let this be it!",5,A 5-star read in any season,1187049600,"08 14, 2007"
A33WA4RMYYN2SL,0002007770,Armchair Reader,1,2,"I enjoyed this book but did not feel it quite lived up to the high ratings I based my purchase on. Part of its appeal was the promise of a circus story. And the story was very realistic in some ways, detailing how difficult and unrewarding (not to mention very dangerous)that life could be.Some of the most interesting and moving parts of the book were actually those that took place in the nursing home that Jacob now lives in, remembering his youth with the circus. The author did a great job in describing the sadness, loneliness and other problems that befall the very aged. Especially those nearly forgotten by their families. Their cold treatment at the hands of people who barely see these elderly souls as human is all too real, having witnessed this myself when working in this type of facility. And another reason why I got out of nursing.The love story was so-so, and years were wrapped up too quickly, at least for my taste. I looked forward to more stories of Jacob as the circus veterinarian. There was alot of potential there for interesting and moving stories about the animals, but that aspect was barely touched upon. Rather it was more about Jacob's obsession with the beautiful Marlena.I loved many of the interesting characters, but always felt I did not quite know them in spite of their frequent appearances throughout the story. Walter the dwarf as an example. He was one of my favorite characters. I found myself wanting more of his own story, but it wasn't there.I would recommend this as a light summer read, but would not look for more than an interesting diversion and brief look into the world of the circus folk when the animals were still transported by train and when the circus coming to town was the biggest news of the month.",3,"Anyone looking for a quick, light read",1282694400,"08 25, 2010"

A3E1CWL47ERIHK,0002007770,"Ash Night ""Nixy""",0,0,"Sara Gruen's new novel, Water for Elephants, challenges the childhood memories of circus acts and clowns with its eye-opening melancholy and beautifully written story. The novel follows Jacob Jankowski as he reminisces about his life as the Benzini Brother's veterinarian. After running away from a life of heavy expectations, Jacob is adopted by Uncle Al and August, the crazy, immoral ringleaders of the circus. The novel's attention to historical detail and well as the strangely believable plot will entrance mature readers.However, to those looking for a light read: this is not it. Water for Elephants was, at times, a little difficult to follow. Gruen's style got a little contrived at times; clich&eacute;s abound. The language is a little flowery at times, the details sometimes overwhelming. Conversely, some may argue that it's part of the book's charm. Gruen spares no detail, making the novel haunting and a little gruesome. The images stay with you: a man thrown bodily off a speeding train, a woman beaten by her bipolar husband, the almost disfiguring endowments of the circus stripper.The details in the story were what made it so amazing. This well-researched novel was heavy on historical fact. Some of the most fantastic and unbelievable aspects of Gruen's book were the ones that were the most true. The writing was beautiful, if unsettling, and I found the story fascinating. While the ending was a bit simple, and more than a little predictable, this captivating read comes highly recommended for mature readers looking for something a little off the beaten path.",4,Captivating!,1204070400,"02 27, 2008"

AFCSYCMKQ3ORV,0002007770,A. SMITH,1,1,"SPOILER ALERTS: (Though I don't give names I do reveal a couple of main plot points).  I decided to read this book after I saw a trailer for the movie.  I just finished it last evening.  It is a quick read with memorable characters and a wonderful yet shocking glimpse into the operation of circus trains/shows long ago.  Although animal cruelty is still present today - the type of treatment described in this novel was unnerving - this is a complement to the author. The reason for the three star rating? One, we're given a glimpse, it's a good glimpse but I think the actual operation of the circus could have been delved into more as well as the veterinary treatment of the exotics. I was also disappointed that the author didn't provide a lot of detail surrounding main plot points. For example: a climactic love scene between characters was reduced to less than a full page (Kindle edition) but I had to read through page after page of a performers graphic pole dance. And the demise of a main character was reduced to less than a paragraph - I couldn't even savor it!  I realize it was a quick read but goodness, I expected more.

I guess, for regular folks who only dream of running away and joining the circus, it was entertaining and everything but was annoyng when narrative style sort of goes back and forth in between Frank McCourt to James Frey.( I am. I do. I think. I feel. I, I, I.... )I don't know, I am less than half of Jacob's age but have been lived and worked in the circus, I just couldn't feel or smell sawdust in it at all. I couldn't see any character's face clearly. As author notes in the end, it is a patchwork of cut and pasted information from her research. I wish the author did bother to travel with the show, any show, awhile. Then she would have understand that big top and cookhouse ready to serve hot meals won't go up in length of just 5 paragraphs even with all the machineries of millennia, let alone of 1930s.There should be generations of elephants handlers to be found in Sarasota and their stories are worth listening to than museum facts, that is if you can get in to their doorsteps and able to decode their language.I understand this book is a fantasy. If you want to smell sawdust, try based on true historic circus figures ""The Final Confession of Mabel Stark"" "" Modoc: The True Story of the Greatest Elephant Ever Lived"" or watch ""Dumbo"" in retro circus.In the category of fiction, even though it caused lot of pain to people all the characters are based too obviously, I'd give ""Roustabout"" some credit because its author was actually there, though not on the tent crew as the heroine.Congratulations anyway, how about donating profit and future movie deal $ to circus vet. funds( for humans and animals) ?",3,watered down elephants,1157500800,"09 6, 2006"

The story starts with moment of violence and from then on is tolerable narrative mess. The main character is a veterinarian student who drops school, joins a circus during the Depression-era, finds love, hate and whatever may crosses his way.The lessons he learns are so valuable that decades later, living in a home for old people, he can still perfectly recall them - and pass them along. He is Jacob, a strange figure, who is no longer an alien when he runs into people even stranger than him. Tod Browning's movie ""Freaks"" comes to mind, but Gruen never reaches the same level.The only redeeming point in the book are the old black and white circuses pictures with scenes from a bygone era. On the other hand, Gruen's heavy-handed prose lacks the sparkling that would enhance ""Water for elephants"". Her storytelling abilities are more focused in the tell - when it should be the showing - missing the chance of creating a whimsical story. We learn every step Jacob takes from a to c, even the unnecessary b. With card-board flat characters, the aninals end up stealing the show.

A1G3YJXP2SNWAC,0002007770,Author Alliance,1,1,"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS by Sara GruenThis is a marvelous book that covers the two bookends of the long adventurous life of Jacob Jankowski, going back and forth from him as a ninety-plus-year old in an assisted living facility, to him thinking back to his days working on the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus that moved around the country in its own train.He is all alone in the nursing home, with most the employees viewing him as more trouble than he is worth, except for one wonderful nurse named Rosemary, who shows him respect and compassion, and is for all practical purposes his only friend at this point in his life. While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book. I will not spoil it for you, but you are certain to like and appreciate it.This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.Hey Joe (Jamaica Series)",5,WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a great book,1374192000,"07 19, 2013"

It's a classic down on his luck boy meets out of his league girl and they fall madly in love story.

Yes, the story telling is brilliant and extremely well written; the parts about the depression and the circus are fascinating; and the ability of a young female author to give voice and depth of character to an old man in his nineties is extraordinary (he is one of literature's most memorable characters!)But for me, there is something which surpasses even all of this.  Gruen touched on and developed a reality with which it is so difficult for most of us to come to grips: that is how the strong, virile, resourceful young man in his twenties continues to reside in the decrepit, rotting body of the stooped, weak old man.  She has drawn so clearly the ungraspable mystery of youth emerging into old age, the spirit of the person masked by the wrinkled cloak of the elderly.  Bravo, Sara.

When I finished, I felt that it was an okay novel, not fantastic, certainly not as great as it had been made out to be, but okay. There is worse out there. And then I read at the end about the sources and stories used for the novel - all the best parts of the book were borrowed from other stories! To me, that just reeks of laziness and lack of imagination. The parts that were apparently created by the author were the most difficult to believe (the lead up story to the main character joining the circus, the love story, etc.), and the most fascinating bits were borrowed. I also agree with the reviewer who took offense at the haphazard use of the ""paranoid schizophrenic"" diagnosis. There is enough stigma about mental illness in the world, and whether or not it was part of the language of the time is beside the point. (For that matter, the dialogue is painfully modern and out of touch with the 1930s anyway.) Perhaps this is another example of laziness on the author's part or an attempt to be sensationalistic.

At the end of the story, it looks like he might get to sell tickets at the circus.  The importance of needing to be needed, even at 93, is a point well made.

She has the main character alternate between his present life in a nursing home and then flashes back to his circus days.  A review above talked about how the main character was the only one with compassion; this isn't true; there is a dwarf and his dog that are amazing characters; Rosemary, one of the nurses at the home and numerous others who are exquisitely crafted. Rosie the elephant who smiles just made me smile throughout. This book will be with me for a very long time;  I never reread books, but this one might just warrant another read.

A75W6T9I2S8BA,0002007770,"B. Case ""InquiringMind""",16,18,"""Water for Elephants"" by Sara Gruen is an utter delight. I read a library copy for my book club, but after I finished I promptly ordered three copies: for my father, for a favorite aunt, and for my husband. I had to restrain myself from buying more.The book is narrated from the point of view of Jacob Jankowski, a ninety-plus year old man living in a nursing home. He is unhappy with everything about his current situation in life. He constantly flails against the every-present reminders that his body has degenerated so that he hardly recognizes himself. He's become the trouble-making curmudgeon of the facility because his mind is fully alive and has not degenerated along with his body.When a circus comes to town and sets itself up across the street, one of the old coots living in the same home brags that he used to work in the circus carrying ""water for elephants."" This gets Jacob's ire up. He knows you can't carry water to elephants. They drink too much! The man is lying. Jacob knows the truth because he really did work in the circus. But those memories are long buried. Now that thoughts of this part of his past are awakened, he starts thinking about those halcyon days of his youth--a time when he learned quickly how to become a man.Thus the story of Jacob joining the circus when he was 23, during the heart of the Depression, when he had nothing in the world he could call his own except promise, inner strength, and fortitude. The world couldn't get any tougher for a young man. He learns quickly, and the hard way about many of the most important lessons in life, and he comes away from the experience a remarkably mature, whole, and admirable man.Two-thirds of the book deals with chapters about Jacob as a young man in the circus. One-third deals with Jacob in the nursing home. It is a proper balance and this construction adds to the tension of the story rather than detracts. You care about this man and root for him in both periods of his life.There is a marvelous feel-good ending, full of great humanity. When you finish, you are left with optimism and enthusiasm that sticks with you for a long time. I recommend this book highly. It is a book that can be appreciated by all ages; in fact, I think it would make an enjoyable and thought-provoking young adult title--but for those men and women who actually went through the Great Depression, this book is a treasure. Buy it for every one of those beloved survivors that you have in your immediate circle of friends and family. These people want for nothing material. It is hard to buy presents for them. But this book will be greeted by long-lasting appreciation.",5,The Perfect Gift for Almost Everyone!,1182470400,"06 22, 2007"

The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional.  I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was.

So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise.  Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop.

I would call it a good novel but not a great one, as there were a few little annoyances to make it fall just that bit short.  There were a few pivotal moments in the story where the motivations underpinning actions crucial to the story weren't particularly strong.  For example, the main character jumps on board the moving circus train and is helped by one the older circus hands.  This is the time of the Great Depression, everything is scarce and people are desperate to hold onto what little they have.  There are no clues as to why this person would help the main character, I would have thought the far more likely action would have been to prevent him from getting a handhold.  Other conveniences follow later - there happens to be a circus within walking distance of the nursing home where the ageing main character resides, and the manager of this circus happens to passing when the main character goes there.They are however relatively minor annoyances and overall the writing is engaging, the dialog and rendering of characters very good.

I typically shy away from stories about the elderly because it is a topic that affects me very deeply and can really be painful to read.  But after I helped care for my 92 year-old grandmother in the week before her death, my mom told me I had to read this and that I'd love it.  She wasn't wrong.The story gripped me immediately with the scene in the menagerie tent.  But I have to say that what I loved the most about this novel was the narrator, Jacob Jankowski.  I fell hard and fast for him from the very first page.  because of this, I purposely read this book slowly so that I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Jacob.  Ms. Gruen did an amazing job not only portraying the life of this man and the interesting friends and enemies he makes while being the vet for a travelling circus, but showing that the elderly have amazing stories to tell.  It showed how dignity is in danger of being lost when elderly people are treated like children once they are of a certain age, but also how so many simple things can bring that dignity back.This book was so wonderful and I found the ending to be uplifting and appropriate and extremely well done.

This book is written with clear attention to detail and descriptions of what life very well may have been like with a train circus during Prohibition and the Great Depression.  In addition to the day-to-day goings on there is the added element of several plot lines of a personal nature with feelings of love, loss, joy and sorrow.  Each character is seen from Jacob's point of view and drawn so clearly that you feel you know them personally. I want Jacob to be my friend and so will you!Definitely a book I will be recommending to most everyone!  I only wish there had not been the need for a few relatively explicit scenes as those few make this book unsuitable for my 11-year-old.  She is a voracious reader and wants to be a writer.

Listening to this story is tremendous, as it easily allows for the two voices of Jacob Jenkowski to be clearly heard and distinguished from one another. This book is a love story, a history lesson, a peek into different elements of humanity that have way too much realism. There were times I wanted to skip ahead because I didn't want to hear the unpleasantness taking place in the story. But of course I didn't. Because one has to endure some bad to appreciate the good. The love story is much more too, than a man and a woman - it involves the circus animals and how they instinctively know who is good and who is not. The history lesson reminds us of a lifetime ago, which really isn't so very far away - less than one hundred years, and helps us appreciate how far we have come.

I was set to buy it - based on others' recommendations and the five-star rating - and I was curious to see what the 74 ""one-star reviews"" had to say.  At first, it seemed as though these bad reviews were just people complaining; I've seen people complain about something popular just to come off as being more sophisticated and cultured than the masses.  As I continued to read the reviews, several issues kept repeating: poorly developed, stock characters, unconvincing dialogue, and the trite and inappropriately-contemporary narrative taking into consideration the period of the story, etc.  Not to mention most of the reviews relating disgust at the gratuitous and awkwardly-written sex scenes.  They also all seem to lament over the thin, predictable plot.  The criticism went on and on.  Not much mincing of words here.  I took one reviewer's advice and searched through the book on Amazon's hard-copy sampler to get a feel for the story...Granted, I only read several pages of the book as I bounced around the sampler - but that's all it took for me to discover the same poor writing described in all of the one-star reviews.  The writing I sampled in Water for Elephants was, in all honesty, no more sophisticated than a middle-school reading level, which was genuinely surprising.  I instantly recognized the complaints listed above, and felt disappointed.  I do believe that the astounding success of this book, unfortunately, speaks volumes of its audience, the average American reader.  That so many give it such high literary praise beyond what it seemingly is - a marginally entertaining ""beach read"" - demonstrates, to me, how comfortable we've become with mediocrity.  I'm writing this review to join the ranks of those who guard their ""five-star reviews"" more closely.

The reader is constantly exposed to a multitude of emotions such as grief, depression, love, passion, and anger.  Jacob's interactions with those on the Benzini Brothers' Most Spectacular Show on Earth, whether they be human or not, shape his life after it appears his whole world has come crashing down on him.This book was a true page-turner.

He hops a circus train which is going through the town and is hired as the show's vet, virtually unpaid by the avaricious circus owner, and sleeping in a train carriage with horses and the circus ""little person"". The cast of circus characters, both performers and roustabouts, as the workers are called, provides an interesting back drop to a story of love, manic hatred and cruelty, especially on the part of one of the trainers who has charge of an elephant named Rosie. The story progresses right through Jacob's life until his nineties when, with his frail body but intact memory, he relives his colourful past.

Because this is achieved, I am fully invested in his world and experiences. Like wise, the supporting characters are dynamic and interesting, but even given their deformities, whether physical or psychologically, they never over shadow the main character.The book provokes thoughts on treatment and intelligence of animals, economy, marriage, class, race, healthcare, friendship and family. As well as, it forces us to take a hard look at how our culture deals with the elderly.""Sometimes the monotony of bingo and sing-alongs and ancient dusty people parked in the hallway in wheelchairs makes me long for death.

The cover is beautiful too, but as the saying goes ""never judge a book by it's cover. I didn't like this book and here is why:The Nursing home: Too much like the notebook, which is why the movie was changed.Characters: If the characters were food, they'd be dry turkey that went down like sandpaper. I think she could've spent more time developing them. I really didn't care about any of their troubles.Movements: The reader doesn't have to know every little movement the cardboard character makes. Everytime he/she stares we know. Everytime he/she looks out the window we know. I felt like it was stage direction.Love: The love just came like a weed out of nowhere. No building to it, no depth, just One day "" Oh, Hi. You have issues because your parents died and oh great! You love animals just like me"" and Jacob was attracted to her since she laid on a horse in sequins - - Boom!  It felt very forced by the writer. I think she should research classic love stories or atleast work on a more believable build up.Husband: The main character's husband was a pseudo-gray character, shifting from bad to good in two seconds. The author didn't spend enough time researching schizophrenia, which was unfortunate because it could've made August a more believable character. I feel she just wanted to give him a reason to be a jerk so that the reader can sympathize with Marlena and Jacob's affair.Marlena: zzzzz. Very boring woman and same as all the other cliche Betty Sue characters. Orphan ofcourse. Abusive husband.Jacob: Didn't really connect with him, but I guess he was okay. Parents died so sympathy is needed.Research: I don't get why everyone is so surprised that the author researched the circus for her book. Every author must research. She did a good job though. Lots of details and I could tell she understood the circus life.Smut: I'm no prude, but the smut is contrived for the sack of being edgy/gritty. For example, Jacob randomly walks in on a masturbating dwarf. And the circus racy side shows - - plus the girl in the beginning whose a tease to Jacob - - oh yeah, and the football team's orgy.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""",1,1,"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a sweeping story of nearly epic proportions that touches on the young, the old, and lost loves, all within one man's life.His name is Jacob Janowski, a grumbling old 93-year-old (or is it 90-year-old?) fart living in an old folks home. Enduring his final days with other old folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read. It also, surprisingly, has a ton of character depth, and not just for human characters but for the animals Jacob tends. Particularly that of Rosie the ""dumb as hammers"" elephant that turns out to be much, much more than what she seems.The ending to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS was absolutely perfect, letting us know that even though the elderly can be crotchety, they serve a much greater purpose than to be wheeled around in chairs and told when, what and where to eat, drink, and think. Finding a home where one belongs is the toughest thing when people get older, and it was a fantastic ending for Jacob to ""go home"" to when the final sentence gets read.",5,A Nearly Epic Tale That Moves On At A Pace,1234396800,"02 12, 2009"

Jacob; who is incensed at this obviously false claim, and alienates himself from the rest of the residents, begins to relive, through a series of remembrances in his mind, his own experiences in the Benzini Brothers circus in his youth.With a cast as colorful as the balloons and flags that you can imagine flying over the bigtop of the Benzini Brothers circus, Jacob's internal narrative weaves a tale of love, loss, betrayal, and murder that is as fine a coming of age story as I have ever read.A thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish.",5,A Wonderful Read,1212105600,"05 30, 2008"

I'm so glad I did, it's wonderful.Jacob Jankowski is 93 (hr thinks) and in an old folks home put out to pasture. He has an enthralling story inside him that many of us only wish we had. Dropping out of college and running away with the circus as a young man, his story unfolds as a true adventure.The circus of the 30's is the back drop for this wonderful yarn and we follow Jacob as he navigates his way around the people, the lore, the language and the pecking order. All the characters are colorful and each brings a dimension to the story that has the reader turning pages as fast as possible. I think I blew through this one in two days. I might have done it in one had I not had commitments I had to keep.The story is interspersed with up to date goings on at the old folks home the aged Jankowski is a resident of but, you can just tell his heart is still on the circus train of his youth. The end of the book is perfect in its simplicity and ""rightness"".To say I thoroughly enjoyed this book would somehow understate the whole experience, to say I loved it would be closer to the truth. If you want something to read that will draw you in like a moth to a flame, this might just be the book. If you want to be taken back to a bygone age of Americana complete with all its misgivings and mayhem, this might be the story.

A7VUQY4DU973M,0002007770,BookAWeekMan,0,0,"&#8203;This #1 NY Times Bestseller, Water for Elephants (&#8220;WFL&#8221;) was released as a film with Reese Witherspoon in 2011, and it offers us a timeless revelation of something that most of us could never fathom, the bygone era of traveling circus life, with grippingly real characters, at an astonishing depth from an author who is too young to know such vernacular much less in depth, and all the wretched animal smells, the poverty of that life, it's inherent tragedies, sprinkled with humor, intrigue and life&#8217;s intensity.  All of this is given to us from the senescent eyes of one ""90 or 93"", and it leaps through his semi-dementia-blurred eyes to his eyes as they were decades past -- the animated, vibrant mind of a large, strong and most admirable, but real, young man, Jacob/Jake Jankowski, a vetenarian, trained at Cornell University among America&#8217;s elite privileged classes, who fell into the depths of the morass of the Americana that one would expect circus-life to reflect.&#8203;Her novel is a much-heralded classic, as modern literature might define it, even if its prose are not of classical stature; the story that she weaves is captivating indeed.  She presents this historical-fiction view of circus life primarily as dialogue, very believable at that and so worth the time to read it, but it wants for more descriptive passages and philosophy to feed our starved minds.  Still, when she is of a mind to do so, she writes memorable lines, thus sprinkling her fascinating plot with tasteful, descriptive metaphors and similes which never impede the flow of the story line nor irritate the spellbound reader.  The plot drifts dreamlike between the disquieting realities of old age and its debilitating manifestations and the all-too vivid memories of circus life and the tragic and wonderful characters and griping events that then unfold.&#8203;Clearly, she has studied seniors and their halting routines in assisted living facilities, and she makes them all too real.  With this, I have two problems.  First, seniors' lives are boring and, worse, awash in sadness.  Second, for one of my age, they strike frighteningly close to home, increasing the appeal of some later self-extinction, a far preferable denouement than the gradual withering and atrophy that time assures.  As such, I rapidly flipped through the chapters dwelling on Jacob's painful, senescent existence.  On balance, I horoughly enjoyed learning so much about circus life in America some 100 years ago and all of the characters and plots of WFL.  Brava, Sara Guen.

He drops everything when his parents die and joins the circus.Jacob was a very easily liked character. I'd have to say the flash forwards were something I really enjoyed. Gruen's seamless writing between past and present is breathtaking. Reading the difference between an older Jacob as opposed to a young one was really intriguing. It was interesting to hear him describe how his body has aged from the vital, handsome young man he once was and how he sees himself as this decrepit old man now. It was so sad but quite hysterical at the same time.I didn't feel like I connected with Marlena too much. Yes, I liked her as a character, but I had a hard time seeing what Jacob thought was so special about her. A character I had a hard time deciding whether or not I liked, from the moment he was introduced, was August. In the beginning you want to like him when he's befriending Jacob, but when he starts slipping up and showing that he is really a very cruel man you immediately switch to despising him.Now Rosie... what can I say about Rosie? She is the cutest elephant ever! I love how Gruen wrote her with such a loveable personality. Well, really how she wrote most of the animals with such great characteristics. Bobo the monkey was also super adorable. Needless to say, something that I had a hard time with while reading this was the animal cruelty. A while back, I read an article from PETA on how elephants - most circus animals, really - are treated and it was just awful. So it was really hard reading it in gruesome detail. But hopefully, it'll make people realize how circus animals are treated so they can make a stand against it.Overall, Gruen has created a beautifully written novel. Her vivid descriptions and accurate portrayal of life in the circus during the Depression were captivating. Not once did I feel that the story dragged on and the ending left me satisfied. I also felt that the pictures of the circus at the beginning of the chapters were a nice touch.I can't wait to see if I love the movie as much as I loved the book.

A7SSCDSCM4PXF,0002007770,booknblueslady,1,2,"I wish that I could say that I was one of the readers of  Water For Elephants, the well researched novel by Sara Gruen, who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930's, but sadly I can't.I am not one who acclaims the romance of  the beautiful Marlena, the circus horse rider and Jacob, whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at Cornell Vet school.  Instead, I am left thinking that perhaps, I should have read Twilight instead.  The an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists, is that it takes the heart out of the book.Though there was enough in the side characters, animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there I often found Gruen's phrasing annoying and clunky.  I have decided in all fairness to Ms Gruen and her many fans that I will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily.",3,I wish I could say,1334966400,"04 21, 2012"

It's an incredible book; brilliant, educational [to an extent] and highly entertaining.  By page ten I was hopelessly lost in its story, and fought sleep to stay awake and finish it.The story is told from the view point of a man named Jacob.  His viewpoint alternates between present time, where he is an elderly man in his 90's, in an assisted living facility which he despises, and also from the past perspective, as he recalls his days as part of a train circus in the 1930's.  When young Jacob's life turns upside down, he jumps a train, not realizing which particular train he jumped--and his world is changed forever.The story has a bit of everything; history, romance, animals, mental illness, corruption...its all in there, and its all in there in a way which leaves you incapable of putting the book down.  I learned a lot of things I didn't know before reading this book.  The intelligence of elephants is far higher than I ever gave them credit for.  I learned about the epidemic of ""Jake Leg,"" which afflicted thousands of lower class folks in the 1930's.  Not to mention how much I learned about the inner working of the train circus industry.At the end of the story is a note from the author, which for that alone the book is worth reading.  Sara Gruen is very insightful and passionate, and I have a great deal of respect for her as a person and an author now.My words aren't doing this story any justice.  There's so much to it.

A2F6N60Z96CAJI,0002007770,Bookreporter,35,43,"Jacob Jankowski is pushing 90 and wallowing in a nursing home, abandoned by his family and surrounded by aged octogenarians who irk him with their senility. He has few pleasures in life --- an astute and friendly nurse named Rosemary and his vibrant memories. As Jacob lies in his bed, drifting in and out of sleep, lucidness and dreams, the compelling story of his experiences as a young man unfolds in Sara Gruen's mesmerizing new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.The year is 1932. Jacob is 23 and just shy of getting his degree in veterinary medicine from Cornell when he learns that his parents have been killed in a horrific accident. Emotionally and monetarily stranded, unmoored and with nothing to lose, Jacob jumps a train and finds himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Starting at the bottom rung of the strict caste system within the ranks of the Circus employees, Jacob's veterinary knowledge quickly garners him a place near the top of the hierarchy, among the company of the hot-headed ringmaster August and his beautiful wife Marlena --- the all-purpose female star of the show.He also finds himself among the company of cantankerous midgets, gloriously endowed ""men's entertainers"" and a menagerie of exotic and soulful creatures. In her previous novels, Gruen has proven herself a master at depicting the uncanny and often astounding bond between humans and animals, and the scenes with Jacob and the creatures under his care are nuanced and lovely. Gruen paints each creature's persona with as much care and detail as she does for the humans, subtly illuminating the similarities and undermining the concept of human superiority. In the Depression-era setting of Jacob's tale, the survival of the humans is inextricably intertwined with that of the animals; they all live in a kind of chaotically symbiotic state where a star horse's sickness could spell bankruptcy and the chance for redemption lies in the acquisition of an elephant named Rosie.Exceptionally drawn as well is the development of a tentative bond between Jacob and Marlena. Jacob immediately is attracted to the lovely Marlena. She takes longer to reciprocate his affection, and throughout their cautious and hesitant budding romance the presence of Marlena's husband looms large and threatening. Gruen's pacing is excellent and the tension among Marlena, Jacob and August simmers and crackles before coming to a brutal and electrifying climax.The transitions back and forth in time, and the mundane events that unfold as Jacob moans and gripes through his days at the nursing home, could have been, in the hands of a less skilled writer, jarring and distracting, breaking the flow and drawing the reader out of the story. But while the crazed, dramatic and often spectacularly bizarre world of the Benzini Brothers is fascinating, as the novel progresses the reader becomes equally drawn into Jacob's present world. His disdain for his aged body and regret over the confusing array of relatives who visit him intermittently and whose names are permanently muddied in his mind is deeply poignant.Gruen spent years researching Depression-era circuses, and the breadth of her knowledge is revealed in all the tiny details that pepper Jacob's memories, but she also has a finely-tuned radar for the magic and mysteries of the human heart. The meat and madness of this novel may appear to lie in Jacob's memories of his younger self, but in her subtle exploration of Jacob as an old man, Gruen finds an equally compelling story.Readers may find themselves churning through this book at a rapid-fire pace, eager to see what lies ahead, then slowing down as they realize the pages are dwindling. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a book that can be read and reread, recommended and handed off between friends; it begs to be discussed and mulled over. With lines of startling beauty, haunting and evocative scenes and finely-drawn characters who dance off the page, readers can dip in and out of the novel, immersing themselves in Jacob's memories. The story and its characters will haunt readers long after they have resurfaced.--- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger",5,A book that will leave any reader wanting more,1149033600,"05 31, 2006"

It's such a beautiful and unforgettable story in so many ways, I don't even know where to begin explaining what an absolutely gorgeous must-read this is.The story is told with two voices. It starts with Jacob, a full ninety or ninety and three years old (he can't quite remember), coming to terms with aging and being left on his own by his children, in a facility for the aged; whilst looking back at his time as a drop-out veterinary student when he joined the circus after his parents death. The second voice is of Jacob during the three months he had joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931, and follows the story of him and Rosie the elephant; and him falling irrevocably in love with another man's wife - a love triangle with a difference, for sure. Both these story lines, Jacob as an old man and twenty three year old Jacob, deals with different sides and facets of Jacob.Sarah Gruen is a master character developer. Main and secondary role players were vividly painted as multi-dimensional characters. She wrote them in such a striking way that before you can stop yourself, you've lost your heart to quite a few of them, including the animals. Rosie, of course, is the star in this book and if nothing else, her trials and tribulations as well as her spectacular sense of humor, had me laughing and wiping tears at the same time.If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book yet, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. As great as the movie was, the book touched me on so many more levels than I could've imagined. I was riveted by the author's writing and the skilful manner in which she pulled me into Jacob's reality. I experienced so many emotions along with the various characters, and at times felt I could strangle August for what he put Rosie, Marlena and Jacob through.Most memorable line which made me smile: ""Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of.""The well-executed, fast-paced plot - fraught with twists and turns - also had moments of humor woven into it, and I finished this book feeling breathless from the anticipation, excitement and sheer excellence of this imaginative story and its realistically-sketched characters. It was clear to me that the author did in-depth research for this novel. If you don't purchase the book, at least watch the movie. But ""Water for Elephant"" definitely makes my list of top ten most memorable books that must be read in one's lifetime.

Life in this environment can be harsh and cruel, but it also has a glamorous side and a close-knit community in which decency sometimes prevails.

I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her. It's a shame, because I love the idea, but it just did not cut it.If you want to read some great non-fiction about sideshows and entertaining attractions, check out Ricky Jay's books.

They didn't always get paid but at least they ate.  Sara Gruen handles her historical data with an exceedingly light touch, she is a marvellous storyteller.  Memorable book, very engaging.

A3OPB9JECFJEHK,0002007770,Brian Asquith,34,40,"Have to say I'm wondering what all the fuss is about this book? Up to about page 190 I found it to be an enjoyable read and had mentioned it to friends. Alas from page 190 onwards I found it losing its grip...maybe it's too long?Most of the characters are underdeveloped to the point that much of the conversation between Jacob and the various circus folks could essentially take place between him and one other - they all sound the same. I've read peoples comments about the trials and tribulations of the characters living through the depression - it doesn't come anywhere close to a classic dealing with the same period, The Grapes of Wrath.The stampede at the end is a tad too contrived, surely the animals would be tearing themselves, and all around them, limb from limb given that they've attacked their handlers in the past. Same goes with Jacobs disappearance from the old peoples home - again too contrived.There is the makings of a great story here but I don't think Gruen is the one to tell it. The opening scenes have Blackie under the authority of Camel and then 3 months down the road Blackie is ejecting Camel from the train? Sorry it doesn't seem credible. August seems like a nasty piece of work but his paranoia was certainly well founded in the end; we're told that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia but does anyone help him out with it? Just seems a convenient way for Gruen to add a villain in to the mix...and I have to question would circus folks even know what it was in the first place, and surely his wife would have helped him try and figure it out...""I left my husband""...""why?""...""he was a paranoid schizophrenic""...""ah, OK, cool""...isn't life a little more complicated than that? And his ultimate demise and how it was conducted is a little far fetched.I guess I'm feeling let down - the book starts off well but alas doesn't maintain the quality. Also found the interview with Gruen to impart nothing of much substance and the ""Questions for Book Groups"" to be of a nature beyond the level of this book - Grapes of Wrath certainly gives rise to concerns about the depression, compassion etc. but this book doesn't. Alas it didn't deliver and I don't think I'll be reading anything else by Gruen based on this.Have to say that I'm a little disgruntled at the thought of Gruen has a couple of dollars of mine and undeservedly so; if I was Gruen I'd be asking myself whether the ending was worthy of the potential shown earlier in the book. Unfortunately, it's books like this that have me buying books secondhand, and for the most part reading the ""classics""; they're classics as they've withstood the test of time - I can't imagine this book doing so. For authors I like I'm more than happy to buy a book new and in the process pay money to the author, but my disappointment with this book is such that I don't think Gruen deserves any reward for it and makes me realise what a financial risk one is making buying new books from untried authors.Why are there so few contemporary authors out there who are deserving of the praise that seems to be lauded upon them so easily these days? For those of you looking for a book that covers the darker aspects of humanity and their situations along with some wonderfully humourous moments then give ""Suttree"" a read by Cormac McCarthy - it's not the easiest of reads but rewards effort.",3,What's all the fuss about?,1189296000,"09 9, 2007"

The first part starts out pretty intense and then snaps you back to present day.  You continute this pattern throughout the book and it can occasionally become intrusive or hard to recognize for a moment. Reading the thoughts of this old man was hard.  It really makes you think about what you'll feel like when you're 90, or 93.I continuted to read even though the first part of the book seemed to move slowly.  After a while of thinking this I noticed I was already half way through the book!  I hadn't realized how easy it was to get sucked into Jacob's thoughts and to invision his world.  The story may not sound like it's written from an actual male's perspective but there is enough information and detail that this fact becomes somehwat mute.  The way his relationships develop with other characters is realistic.  The way he connects to his animals is even better.I will say that the very ending was nice, but left a little to be desired.

I love reading books that are adapted into films, so I figured I'd get a head start on this one -- anything about a circus, I figured, would at least be interesting.  I wasn't disappointed.  The protagonist is likeable, which is a must for me, the plot is well developed, and I like the continual transition from present-day Jacob to twenty-three year old Jacob.  That said, I really wish the book were longer.  I finished it in a single afternoon and I really thought the ending had been sewn up too quickly: So Rosie the elephant conveniently dispenses with August and our couple are left to live happily ever after...eh... I was expecting something more dramatic, more violent: a Jacob/August showdown, if you will.  But the book seems to move too fast to accomodate a scene like this.  Really, that's my only complaint, though.I snuck a peek at the other reviews before buying the book, and I was slightly put off about references to graphic sexual material and animal cruelty.  And I have to say, I don't get it.  The animal cruelty is there, sure, but there isn't much talk about blood and gore -- it's more about how Jacob responds to the cruelty, in my view.  It doesn't make it any less disturbing, but it's not really horror movie material either.  As for the sex stuff, I don't get what the fuss is about.  You can pick up almost any generic romance novel and read stuff that is far more graphic than what is found here.  And I think it's marketed as an adult novel, so no problems there...In conclusion, it's a good book.

A29V8A62NCP7QA,0002007770,Brittany Jackson,0,0,"Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski, and almost-veterinarian whose life has just fallen apart. As he comes to this realization, Jacob stumbles upon the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus train and hops aboard. He quickly secures his place on the show as the menagerie vet, a position that will change his life forever.Sara Gruen weaves an incredibly realistic tale that allows the reader a rare glimpse into the prohibition era circus lifestyle. The amount of tension throughout the book is always palatable. I often found myself clenching my jaw and holding my breath by the end of a chapter. August is a particularly well-developed character, frightening in the most realistic and entirely plausible way. There is a sense of impending destruction and collapse that builds with each paragraph.This tension is gracefully relieved every few chapters by visiting Jacob, age ninety (or ninety-three), in his current state as a resident at an assisted living facility. Through the telling of Jacob's present story, the reader reaches another level of understanding and can comprehend the meaning of Jacob's earlier experiences in entirely new ways. The tale would be much less satisfying without this continuation of the story, however small it may seem.An issue that must be addressed when talking about Water for Elephants is the treatment of animals. Some scenes in the book are very difficult to read, but it's worth reading through. You will fall in love with so many of the animals as though they're human, and you will be satisfied with their redemption.For me, Water for Elephants receives 5/5 stars. I consider it a ""must read"" that will forever change the way you think. It's the type of story that won't soon leave your mind.",5,"Excellent story, not easily forgotten",1297296000,"02 10, 2011"

A3F0OFSE2M25U2,0002007770,bronx book nerd,2,2,"Sara Gruen did a fantastic job of recreating the circus life in the 1930's as well as presenting us with the daily struggles of living of a contemporary man in his 90's who lives in a nursing home.  This man is the main protagonist of the novel, who recounts his story from his last days in vet school whose life trajectory takes him to the circus after a tragic incident.  The novel is rich with visual imagery of circus life - the animals, the workers, the performers, the props, the train travel etc - and as rich with the depressing conditions of a nanogenarian living in a nursing home - the daily struggles to handle basic life skills, relationships with the staff and other residents, and, saddest of all, the knowledge of the sense of loss of one's memory, and with that, the eventual loss of connection to relatives.  The narrative moves quickly and aggressively, taking the reader back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, with each venue progressing dramatically towards its conclusion.  The main charcater, Jacob, is sympathetic, and you root for him all the way, accompanying him along his travails of adjustment to circus life and his love interest.  You get wrapped up in the drama and stay along eagerly on the ride.Here are my minor objections(The first is directed at author and editor.):  In a span of two pages the author uses the exact same phrase regarding some anticipated emotion from different characters.  It's jarring to read, and you go back to see if you misread it - but no.  Not a big deal but it interrupted the flow.  Bad enough, but the same phrase (or almost the exact same phrase) appears again near the end of the book about the same emotion, and, once again, I'm jarred and lose the focus of the story.  It seems like an amateurish mistake by author or editor.The other problem I had was that, at times, some of the circus characters were borderline stereoptypical/cartoonish, as if the protagonist is one of a few only real people.  Finally, the concluding chapter had some elements to it of a Hollywood happy ending, with an implausible change of attention from tragedy to negotiation.",4,very Good Novel with Some Minor Flaws,1200614400,"01 18, 2008"

AX724J32HPG1J,0002007770,Bruce J. Wasser,6,13,"The archetypical American novel features a solitary protagonist undertaking an odyssey in which he/she confronts both physical and moral challenges and through which he/she emerges with a renewed spirit, transformed by the crucible of confrontations with adversaries, both real and imagined.  Sara Gruen's engaging ""Water for Elephants"" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life.  Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero.  ""Water for Elephants"" is a triumph  --  of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.The innocent Jacob, on the threshold of graduating from Cornell veterinary school and returning to the Midwest to practice medicine with his father, is shattered by the sudden accidental deaths of his parents.  Unmoored from his past and unable to focus on his final examination, he abandons his former life the moment he jumps on board a passing train.  To his astonishment, he has leaped into the midst of a traveling circus, and, thanks to the flinty care of several roustabouts, manages to gain employment with the tawdry Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus dominated by a sadistic ringmaster and populated by a cast of characters, admirable and evil in equal proportions.  In a manner of weeks, Jacob immerses himself as the circus ""vet,"" forms abiding friendships, falls is love and faces moral dilemmas that tie his conscience into Gordian knots.Some critics have likened Jacob to his biblical counterpart and praised the novel for its allusions to the Bible.  In my opinion, Jacob mirrors a less sanctified model, Huckleberry Finn.  Like Huck, Jacob flees familiar surroundings, flaunts social norms, befriends outcasts and risks his personal safety in order to adhere to a hard-earned sense of conscience and social responsibility.  Both Huck and Jacob confront mendacious adversaries, rejoice in life on the lam and re-invent themselves.  Like Twain, Sarah Gruen writes with inordinate respect about the dispossessed and with painful awareness about the inexplicable capacity for the human heart to do well in the midst of spiritual darkness.  As Twain has written  --  and as Gruen affirms  --  the source of humor is pain.Even the title bespeaks our capacity for misrepresentation.  The elderly Jacob, shunted away by his family in a assisted-living nursing home, excoriates a new resident who has claimed to have carried water in buckets for elephants when he was a youngster.  Aware of an elephant's enormous drinking capacity, Jacob knows a lie when he hears one.  And well he should.  The entire purpose of the traveling circus is deception, an enterprise where rubes are separated from their money by gaping at mangy animals, staring at sideshow freaks (many of whom are frauds) or being serviced by ""exotic dancers.""  Falsehoods, illusions and duplicity are the moral big tent under which circus performers enchant Depression men and women hungry for escape.  The central conflict of the novel rotates around Jacob's involvement with a married woman and the peculiarly disturbing aspects of her husband's mental state.  This conflict is rife with secrecy, duplicity and tormented twisting of ideas of right and wrong.It is no surprise that this novel is a best-seller.  Written with extraordinary narrative drive, populated by characters who truly represent our national character and animated by a young man whose journey for self-discovery is our own, ""Water for Elephants"" intimately involves us in Jacob Jankowski's search for meaning.",5,"Huck Finn move over, Sara Gruen has created a soul-mate in her majestic novel",1187136000,"08 15, 2007"

He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?! I'm not brushing off wife-beating here, but really?! One flipping black eye and August deserves to die? I would have killed that bastard for beating AND torturing Rosie LONG BEFOREHAND!! And then Jacob keeps harping about it: ""He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!"" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses ""paranoid schizophrenia"" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be ""paranoid,"" turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though.

His body betrayed him years ago and Jacob now fears that his mind isn't far behind. Shuffling along miserably behind his walker, he's living out his final days in the nursing home and hating every minute of it. Just another invisible senior citizen who's family and the world as a whole has forgotten about.When the circus comes to town and sets up its Big Top tents across the street Jacob comes alive and through a series of flashbacks begins to tell us his life's story. Taking us back to when he joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth, a traveling circus he toured with during the great depression.At the age of 23 Jacob had a predictable future set out ahead of him, one that certainly didn't involve joining the circus. However with his parents untimely death and the bank foreclosing on his family home Jacob soon finds himself homeless, heartbroken and mentally quite unable to sit his final veterinary exams. When an exotic, animal filled train steams toward him Jacob doesn't even think. Flinging himself aboard the boxcar and inadvertently changing his destiny forever.I absolutely adored this book, alternately falling in love with both Jacob, the crotchety old man and Jacob, the young, moral and penniless circus veterinarian. Water For Elephants transported me to another time and quickly became one of those books I never wanted to end.Author Sara Gruen has researched the depression era circus life down to the smallest of details and I feel that this captivating and vivid story will appeal to almost anyone.Filled with action, adventure and a sweet forbidden romance there is also a fascinating sideshow of secondary characters including a clever Polish Elephant, a grouchy little person as Jacob's roommate and a cruel and schizophrenic animal trainer whose wife Jacob just happens to fall in love with. All of this has been wrapped together with a compelling and innovative behind the scenes look aboard a travelling circus train. Showing us more often then not the darker side of circus life after the big top closes down. This is a love story, a life story, an animal lover's story but above all it's a circus story and who of us hasn't dreamed about running away and joining the circus at some point in our lives?

A29ZBAY2CPEC5K,0002007770,Busy Bookworm Reviews,1,1,"Water For Elephants is one of the best books I have read this year. Initially, I did not have any interest in reading this book because it involved a circus and I am not a huge fan of circuses. But at the insistence of some friends, I picked it up and began reading. Boy am I glad I did!Jacob Jankowski is a young man who is thrust mercilessly into the aftermath of the cruelties of life. Despite his circumstances, however, he is a good and honorable man and his compassion and honor shine through on every page of this book. He is a character that reader's immediately fall in love with and can relate to on some level or another. The story itself grabs you instantly and takes you back to a time where traveling circuses were the biggest events in town.Set in the 1930's, Water For Elephants offers a glimpse into a very strange and wonderous world of circus folk during a time when many, if not most, of the country was unemployed and doing anything they could to earn a buck or at least a meal. It was fascinating to read of the lifestyle of the circus workers and how they were treated, how they related to one another, how they treated their animals and what they thought of the townspeople they traveled the country to entertain.Water For Elephants is also a story that tells of the love and life of Jacob and Merlena and their love for the animals that they come to know while working with them in the circus. The book is beautifully and vividly written, the characters well developed and easy to love (or hate as the case may be) and the animals' antics, especially Rosie, will make you laugh out loud.Water For Elephants is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it!",5,Awesome!,1257811200,"11 10, 2009"
A1BI8PUEHA5CHW,0002007770,Busy Mom,1,1,"I just spent the last fifteen minutes looking at the reviews ~~ and it's very interesting to read all the comments as well. There are so many varied responses to this book that the author must be in heaven to get so many responses to this book.I first heard of this book last spring when a fellow Amazon reviewer told me that I ""just had to read it."" I wasn't that inclined since the price was not favorable and the waiting list at the library was too long. However, in my book club, it was the November book to discuss. So when I saw it on the table at the local bookstore for buy three, get one free, I snapped it up. It is not a decision that I have regretted. It is one of the better entertaining books of fiction that I have read this year, if not one of the best. And I read a lot.There are some disaparities in this book as with others, but I think people tend to forget that a work of fiction is simply that, a work of fiction. Not everything's going to ""mesh together"" as in real life. That's why you read nonfiction if you like everything in its proper place and order. This book is simply a fanastic tale of a man facing the end of his life in a dreary nursing home setting, and reliving some of the best moments of his life. A young orphan who happened to jump the train to get away from the tragedy that was his life happened to be on a circus train. He didn't plan to run away to the circus, he just stumbled on the circus train while grieving. And stayed. Fell in love with the most beautiful girl in the world who is happened to be married to the ringmaster. What a story!This novel alternates between Jacob's present and past ~~ he relives the first three months of being in Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and seventy years prior, he was the Benzini Brothers' vet, taking care of the underfed animals of that show. He worked with all kinds of people and animals. It was an exciting life ~~ how many people do you know that lived a life like that? Marlena is the wife of the psychotic ringmaster who alternately abused his wife, his animals and co-workers. Rosie is the elephant bull that Uncle Al, the owner of the circus, bought for a song, hoping that Rosie will be the biggest draw to his circus.The descriptions in this novel are lavish. One can see the sawdust in the air as the big top was put up. One can see the cotton candy being spun. One can feel the humiliation of an old man having to take a shower under the watchful eye of the nurse in the nursing home. One can feel his love for the beautiful show girl. And all of this is tied together beautifully, both past and present. It is a glimpse into a life of a man.Why didn't I give it a five star? Simply because I felt that the endings to both stories were rushed. I did not expect it to have such happy endings since the stories were more gritty and realistic.

A2ZATPER188K3J,0002007770,B. Wilfong,3,4,"Water for Elephants is an interesting text because it is not especially well written, the story is pure soap opera, and yet it is an enjoyable read that at times evokes a long gone era. I think it suffers from overly effusive praise and so many readers are bitterly disappointed once they get through it.First, let's look at the strengths of the novel. I enjoyed the evocations of circus and train life. Gruen clearly spent some time working on these descriptions of circus life and there are little Depression era details that were nice historical jewels for the reader to mine. Also effective was her characterization of old Jacob. His voice was witty and biting and he provided the most pleasure of any character in the text. Chapter nineteen of the novel is the saddest depiction of rest home life I have read in literature. A man is forgotten by his family, and the scene is heartbreaking.Now to examine the reasons why this book is unsatisfying. First off the characters from the 1930s parts of the novel are some of the weakest characterizations I have seen in a book in a long time. They are stock characters at best, and the villains are the mustache twirling men from melodrama. It is hard to care about any of the characters because they are so transparently fake. Even more distracting then the weak characterization is the incredibly insipid (and modern sounding) dialogue Gruen puts in their mouths. She has such nice historical details in the setting of the text, why couldn't she also use it in the dialogue?Many readers have found the ending unsatisfying, and although it is ridiculous, it fits the novel so I won't argue with it. The cloying depiction of animals is also a little beyond the pale, but again, I simply had to come to terms with the novel for what it is. It is popular fiction. It is a melodrama you will get caught up in. And for those purposes it is adequate. Don't go into it expecting more than what it is capable of giving and you will be satisfied.",3,Melodrama (3.5 stars),1262390400,"01 2, 2010"

It was so well written, goes seamlessly between the past and the present. The love story (was it between he and Marlena or he and Rosie?) was lyrically written. The author did an amazing job of pulling me back and forth between the two. I even shed a few tears over a few different things. I'm not an animal activist, but certain parts of this book made me very uncomfortable. The history of the circus is pretty well known. We know the animals were mistreated (heck, they are today too), but the author writes so well about this subject that I found it hard to swallow that lump in my throat. It's obvious she did some major research into the subject matter.When I originally read the description for this book, it was on my ""skip it"" list, but a few of my friends read it and told me I ""had"" to read it.

I have always stood in the back of crowds at Mardi Gras parades due to my major fear of horses!  But this book to me was enough about the human side as to make the circus details palatable, even interesting.I especially enjoyed the story line at the ""retirement community"" since I have a good friend who works at one, and I used to advertise for the place when I had a radio talk show called ""Life Begins at 50"".

The other half is about Jacob's life as a young man in the circus.  Jacob runs off to join the circus, literally, when he is just about to graduate from college.  Devastated by the loss of his family and fortune, he turns to the only thing he knows and loves--the one connection he has to his veterinarian father--the animals.  Jacob gets a job 'watering the elephants', and one grouchy elephant in particular, as he works as the circus animal veterinarian.  Jacob also has the really dumb luck of falling for Marlena, a trick horse rider.  Marlena just happens to be married to the circus boss, a sadistic man who beats her and the elephants.  The whole situation is a powder keg waiting to explode.Interspersed with this is the story of present-day Jacob and his longing, so tender and sad, that pulls on the heartstrings.

A2OPHP0X4N8VCI,0002007770,"Carol ""Carol Deming Casey""",0,1,"I had no anticipation of what to expect when I began reading Water for Elephants.  The most enlightening aspect of the story was the education I received about the hierarchy of employees within the circus.  From an outsider who has always been taught (but never believed it) that people in the circus where of lower class than others, I had no idea there were different ranks of people within the circus.  Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane.  From the beginning the book was colorful with characters.  The transitioning between the past and the present with the main character was an interesting transition.I try to approach a book with an open mind and throw other opinions out the window.  I am pleased I have done this because the people that I know who have read this book have ranged from horrible to excellent.  I found this book entertaining and engrossing. It was never a book that I just could not put down, but I enjoyed read it.  Because the era in which the reference of the circus occurred the comparison of food lines and the great depression was evident.  Although the inhumane treatment of the people and animals undoubtedly occurred during this time period, it wasn't easy to read it.  Although the hierarchy of the class of people was evident within the circus, it was not unlike how society actually was during this time period.  The author clearly did research to solidly base the sad realities of the treatment of people and animals during the depression era.The author weaved a story with vivid characters and animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light.  Sara Gruen's engaging ""Water for Elephants"" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life. Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero. ""Water for Elephants"" is a triumph -- of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.After all of this being said, I am on the fence as to whether this book lives up to all the buzzes and even deserving of being made a movie.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.

A3DKLB4HDBH5B,0002007770,Caroline G. Hemenway,21,24,"At first, the notion of reading a book about the seamy side of a 70-year-old circus sounded like an automatic rejection when I casually picked it up off Mom's side table in Buffalo at Christmas. I intensely dislike circuses and always have. But I always love Mom's book choices - we regularly exchange reading lists - so, given a choice between doing sloppy dinner dishes and pretending to read so I could look hands-off-me engrossed, I hunched down in the chair and read a few pages. Then a few more, then a couple of chapters. Then I vaguely heard my husband yelling that we HAD to leave or we'd be late for something or other. Dang!Two weeks later, back home 8 hours away, I couldn't stop thinking about it when I lead my annual book club retreat at which each 18 of us presents two book choices, argues in their favor, and we each vote for six. The top 11 get picked for the year. My passionate plea gave Water for Elephants an elite spot there. Now I had an excuse to exchange my kids' college education fund for an Amazon order. The book arrived on my bedside table in three days and didn't have time to gather dust as I polished it off in the next two.The story is captivating right from the start because the scenery and characters are so richly portrayed and the plot thickens like creme brulee. I adore books that are based on fact and comprehensively researched - even fiction - and this was a beautifull amalgamation of many true circuses. Sara Gruen exposed me to a world I never would have entered if she hadn't pulled it all together and made the circus a character in itself, filled it with compassion and drama, and layered it so well. She moves from the realm of an all-too-real current nursing home that is as disturbing as it is humorous and insightful, to a thoughtful young man's coming of age that is as disturbing as it is humorous and insightful. I came away with a new appreciation for circuses, old men, and the sometimes treacherous journeys that face all youth.A caution, though. I would not rank this as among the most elevated reads, but it isn't meant to be. It's a wonderful tale and I'd put her in the same category as Barbara Kingsolver or Somerset Maugham. A terrific storyteller. But not quite literature in the finest sense of that word, where Tolstoy and Joyce and Hugo thrive. But too much of them shatters bedside tables. So now I'm waiting for Gruen's next to lighten the load of my day.",4,"Captivating Tale, Rich Characters",1176163200,"04 10, 2007"
A14BHTPDYPBTN8,0002007770,"Caroline W. ""Caroline W.""",1,1,"I loved this book. I loved the circus atmosphere and the story. It was exceptionally well-written, and I enjoyed every page.We have a vet student joining a circus, with mistreated animals he's frantically trying to save and protect. We have a lovable elephant. The narrator is an old man looking back, and he recounts his tale in the immediacy of present tense as he describes situations that happened decades earlier. Interesting, and very effective choice, to write in present tense throughout.The ONLY thing that keeps me from giving the book five stars was the lack of character development for Marlena. Throughout the story I understood the protagonist loved her, but she seemed to be the woman tied to the railroad tracks throughout - Nell being constantly tormented by Snidely Whiplash - and I never really got a sense of her as a person. Maybe I missed it (not surprising - I read the book in daily spurts while I walked a treadmill), but I didn't even know how old she was. I got a much clearer picture of minor characters, like Rosemary, Kinko and Camel, than I ever did of her.I also never understood the whole ""water for elephants"" thing that the protagonist railed about in the beginning of the book.

The story begins as Jacob prepares to sit for his veterinary exams at Cornell University. He receives word that his parents have been killed in a car accident and things go downhill from there. He ends up as part of a circus and the next three-and-a-half months are mostly a living hell, except for Marlena.The story goes back and forth between the present time in the ""assisted-living"" home where Jacob resides and his memories of the past. His children/grandchildren/great grandchildren take turns visiting him, but first-born son, Simon, misses the most important day of all. In the end, this misstep creates for Jacob, and the reader, a most satisfying end to a moving and heartwarming life story. (A bonus in this book is what the reader learns about circus life in the early part of the 20th century, most of which is pretty nasty.)As I care for my aged mother in her home, I am very grateful that we have been able to keep her here.

A3BV4CAK7TPQ0O,0002007770,Carrie Kellenberger,1,1,"I don't care what the reviews say, I thought Water for Elephants was a great read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Jacob's stories, both in the past and in the present, were extremely well written. I found his innocence and charm as a young man quite enchanting. Wouldn't it be grand if all young men were as courteous and as sweet as the young Jacob Jankowski? I also really liked the crotchety 90-year old Jacob, whose temper tantrums and emotional outbursts were most certainly justified. The loss of independence is something that we all fear, even more so when a person has lived a long and full life only to be left alone in a senior's home to die.I also thought Marlena's character was well-written. Divorce in the 1920s and 1930s was unheard of, and I can only imagine how awful it must have been for a woman to realize that she had to endure the rest of her life with someone she despised. I found myself wondering when she was going to make the decision to live for herself, rather than do what everyone expected her to do. Then again, she had already made that decision once by leaving her family, so I expected that she would come to the right decision at some point.As for Gruen's research into circus life during the Depression, I think that she did a fantastic job. America during the Great Depression is such a fascinating piece of history, and when you add the excitement of an all-American circus show to the mix, it becomes ever more so.

As he faces the realities of his advanced age and begins to deal with the ravages of time on his body, Jacob reflects on his younger years, when he worked as a veterinarian for a traveleing circus known as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  He joins the circus at 23, at the height of the Great Depression, right after his parents are killed in a car accident and right before he graduates from veterinary school.Most of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is written in flashback, taking readers back to Jacob's beautiful and strange years with the circus during the 1920s and '30s.  While working for the circus, Jacob falls in love with two girls:  Marlena, the circus's star performer, and Rosie, a bull elephant no one else seems to want.  But there are complications, of course:  Marlena's husband, August, is the ""equestrian director"" of the circus--and he's also very possessive, obsessive, unpredictable, and cruel, not past beating both his wife and his animals if they don't adhere to his commands.  But Jacob's love for Marlena and Rosie transcends all this, and it will change his life; he has no way of knowing how much. Now, as an old man near the end of it all, trapped in a body he doesn't recognize, Jacob clings to his memories, to the vestiges of his younger years, as if they are a life raft.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of Jacob Jankowski's life--gritty, surreal, full of vibrance and love. In her third novel, Sara Gruen brings to life a dazzling cast of characters in a vivid landscape little-explored in contemporary fiction.  The world she has created for her readers is, well, otherworldly:  magical and strange and startlingly real.  Her Depression-era train circus resounds with authenticity; she borrows anecdotes from her research and uses circus slang to add a sense of immediacy to the experience. Her prose is simple and unpretentious, poetic in its own way.  Simply put:  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is just lovely!I can't say anything bad about WATER FOR ELEPHANTS; I think it deserves every bit of praise it receives.  Jacob is such a compelling character, so utterly well-drawn.  His vibrancy as a young man jumps off the page at you; so does his frustration with being trapped in a withering body as an old man.  Gruen's tale moves back and forth in time seamlessly, and it's obvious how much she cares about her characters--even the non-human ones.  Her love story is impeccably researched, alternately heartbreaking and hopeful, romantic and violent. And the ending?--it's absolutely perfect.  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS took me somewhere no other piece of fiction ever has--and I can honestly say I enjoyed every page of the journey.",5,A FANTASTIC novel!,1155686400,"08 16, 2006"

I found it hard to get mildly attached to anyone, aside from Rosie.

A8ANAGMQXVT8R,0002007770,CC,1,1,"** spoiler alert ** Before I picked this much talked about book, particularly since the film came out, I heard from a few friends that they couldn't read it because of the animal abuse. When I thought that's what the book was about, I actually didn't want to read it either not because I care so much but because I'm not quite as impassioned on the topic. It's not that I'm heartless or ignorant of that. It's just that I don't need to read anything about that topic to make me ""feel"" the injustice. But, with the hype and since I love to compare books to film, I figured I had to read it before I saw the film with Edward...ahem I mean Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. So, I did and immediately I was drawn in. I enjoyed how the narrative sliced between present day retirement home and past circus life. I appreciated the difficulties and heartaches of dealing with old age and time passing, with loneliness and loss of certain freedoms, with death. Of course, I also loved how the two main characters grew, fell in love, and fought against the obstacles to be together.It actually reminded me of Sparks' The Notebook. So, if you liked that and you like the circus, this is definitely the read for you. And for those animal rights activists, I didn't find the scenes of animal abuse that offensive. That topic is definitely a character in the book and certainly touched upon vividly BUT it's not accepted as just fact.

It was a quick read, and very disappointing.I found myself too often angry with the poor choices that the characters made. I also found myself freqently questioning implausible scenes (for example: Jacob's friends being tossed from the train while Jacob himself was on top of the train, struggling unaware towards the villian's car--ridiculous!--he would have seen or heard the others who were carrying out this murderous eviction, wouldn't he?).The love story aspect of Jacob and Marlene was not believable in the slightest to me--in fact it was abhorent.  August's bizarre and sadistic behavior is attributed to paranoid schizophrenia, however, the author did not have a good handle on describing that psychiatric disorder.Despite some trifles of circus history interwoven into the story, the circus in question is as underdeveloped as the characters. The author suggests that this work parallels the Biblical story of Jacob. I didn't know that until AFTER I had read the book, and would NEVER have dreamed of a connection without her assertion; that's really far-fetched.Unfortunately, the undercurrent of animal abuse, neglect, and suffering is what will linger in my mind as I reflect on, ""Water for Elephants.""I would NEVER want to see a movie based on this book!",2,I loved the elephant . . . but disappointing,1325376000,"01 1, 2012"

A2VZ11U5DXM8J5,0002007770,"C. Ebeling ""ctlpareader""",2,2,"I could not help but notice that reading Sarah Gruen's Water For Elephants is very much like watching the movie ""Titanic.""  First and foremost, each offers big historic pageantry, with a rousing ""you are there"" quality.  Each features two parallel narratives from the same protagonist, one in advanced age, one in a defining passage in young adulthood.  Both feature a romantic triangle involving a young woman who is a victim of her times stuck in a marriage or engagement to a cruel powerful man and the young man of no means who becomes her soulmate and savior.  Both send the young man to a fancy dress dinner in a borrowed tux. Both create insular worlds that are set apart from the rest of the earth, one by an ocean, the other by the train-bound peripatetic exotica of circus life, and within that insular world there is a class structure inspiring social commentary.  Both the Titanic creators and Gruen took admirable artistic risks in going to material that nobody else was treating and both did their homework on historical detail.Water For Elephants is about circus life in the early years of the Great Depression.  It successfully captures glimpses of the American experience and opens up the closed world of the circus that is at once a very dangerous place and a warm sanctuary.  Gruen does not spare the gritty reality of disregard for human and animal life.  She succeeds in creating a very delicately balanced community that can slide into disaster if shoved off balance.  Thinking on the living conditions she portrays, sometimes you have to ask, why would anyone stick with this mess?  For the narrator, Jacob Jankowski, it is love for animals, friends and the aforementioned girl.Water For Elephants is, like the Titanic, a large scale entertainment but when it comes down to it, there is no one line or character that is surprising (except perhaps for the elephant).  The book is well crafted but not artistic.  It may have been very different in the hands of John Steinbeck or EL Doctorow.  That said, Gruen gets points for following through on her inspiration and delivering a book that is very atmospheric and historically interesting, with some social commentary mixed in.This edition comes with a worthwhile interview with Gruen and a book club discussion guide that is more like a junior high English class test.",4,Big Hearted,1250640000,"08 19, 2009"

The author does a great job of transporting you to this era and what it actually like to be apart of a great circus traveling by train. The author gives very detailed and explicit images of the scenery, animals, costumes and characters.However there are not smooth transitions from character to character due to the main character telling the story as an older man and hid younger self. It was hard sometimes to distinguish the difference between characters so much so I had to go back and re-read a page an then be like oh okay this is so and so.***SPOILER ALERT BELOW***I didn't care for the ending of this book either. I didn't think that it was realistic for the main character to leave his nursing home without aide (since in the story he can barely make it from the table to the window). Also he can barely button 3 buttons on his shirt, so how is he going to sell tickets at the booth to the circus? He meets a young man and he just volunteers to take care of him for the rest of his life (and he's 93)?

The drama and suspense holds the reader's attention and captures the imagination. This is how a historical book should be written.She also has a remarkable understanding of the human heart, making this one of the best romance stories this reader has read in decades.

The first few pages hooked me and it was all I could do not to put the book down til the very last page. I spent a season with the blue unit of Ringling Brothers back in the 80s and even though the life has changed a great deal from the circus trains during the depression, the lifesytle is quite similiar. The different cliques, the constant travel schedule and life on the road. I remember many a nights sitting with other ""joeys"" and talking with the oldtimers who told similiar tales as in Water for Elephants.  My thanks to Sara for bringing back some great memories of my own circus career and putting a great story to such a facinating and unknown part of history for many people.  I do wish she had gone a little deeper into some of the other acts and aspects of circus life, but maybe there is another novel about life on the Ringling circuit. Loved the ending - so appropriate. Have recommended this book to all my friends and if you are looking for a thriling, dramatic read, this book is for you. Does not matter if you are not into circus life, this is so much more.

It also provides a look into the fascinating world of the train circus, with its hierarchies, lingo, and dangers, providing as a bonus a great deal of what appears to be historically correct information.Gruen's writing is well-suited to the content, bringing characters and scenes to life in well-chosen detail and dialog that rings true to the characters.

But sitting 24/7 with Lisa allowed me little time to do anything other than read - so I did. A visitor at my facility one day told me of ""Water for Elephants"" and promised to send me a copy. It arrived several days later. I read this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. I purchased 20 more copies which I gave as Christmas presents to all cared and loved my little Lisa and the incredible team of veterinarians across the country who worked so hard to try and cure her.

Each person in our group rated it a 5, which generally means the book was so good we couldn't put it down.I qualified my vote by saying I would give it a 5 for the author's work in researching her material and in linking Jacob's 90 or 93-year old self to his younger self along with her use of dreams and/or daydreams.The book was a page-turner as another member of our group had told me.  It arrived from amazon.com on Tuesday after I finally decided to pay full price for it since I was not finding a really good buy for a used copy elsewhere online.I am generally a slow reader, wanting to picture each event in my mind before I continue.  However, the book went pretty fast since it has a lot of dialog.One thing our book discussion group questioned.  How could Jacob be so sure that Mr. McGuinty could not have carried water for the elephants?  Couldn't he have been one of a number of boys who carried buckets of water to the elephants?  The author did not explain this.We saw some similarities to the Jacob in the Bible, but perhaps we missed some which the author included.  My Bible tells me that the name Jacob means ""deceiver"" so in what way were we deceived by him?

Well, really, for most of the book. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy the old Jacob parts, they were very well written. The young Jacob parts were so well written, the change from one perspective to the other often threw me out of the story. I would be reading along, really into the story. Bam! Now we're back in the nursing home. It really distracted me. I even noted, about the third time this happened, that there better be a reason for the back and forth or I would look at it as a crutch the author felt she had to use. I still don't feel it was totally necessary to have old Jacob, but it was nice to have the closure that point of view was able to give us.Regardless, I will be recommending this book to all the readers I know.

Water for Elephants is wonderfully written in first tense by Jacob Jankowski, a young man recently 'orphaned' with veterinary training, who happens to hop a train and join the circus.  From the Prologue on, you enjoy the story as Jacob jumps between his days with the circus and his present day life in a nursing home.  The story of the animals, from Queenie a jack-russell terrier, the show horses, an orangatang named Bobo, and to Rosie the elephant who only understands Polish, is very heart touching.

I read and enjoyed Gruen's other two books ""Riding Lessons"" and ""Flying Changes"" but was overwhelmed by ""Water for Elephants"".  I liked the fact that the past is being recalled by a 90 (possibly 93) year old man - you don't find many books that have an elderly protaganist and it was refreshing.  I enjoyed the many animals in the story - Rosie and Bobo especially.  I enjoyed learning about the traveling circuses and felt that Gruen really did do a wonderful job researching this book (I think the old circus photos added a nice touch, too).

ARBMZ59SXGUGI,0002007770,C. Hill,2,3,"It's the early 1920s. Jacob Jankowski is about to finish up his veterinary degree at Cornell University when he learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash. Stunned by this awful and sudden turn of events, Jacob completely blanks while taking his final exams. He walks out and wanders out of town in a complete daze, eventually jumping a train. It turns out he has jumped the circus train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob pretty much instantly falls for Marlena, one of the star performers. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the animal manager, who is, as we come to find out, a paranoid schizophrenic with erratic behavior problems. The story focuses on these three characters as the circus train makes its way around the country, performing in various cities. Along the way, the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob befriends his reluctant roommate, and tries to save an ailing friend from being tossed from the circus.This is a really interesting and moving book. It's really fascinating to read about daily circus life and how things worked. And it's a touching story about a smart elephant, a compassionate vet, and a forbidden love. I do wish there had been some more charater development for Rosie the elephant, though. Also, the story is told in retrospect, from a present-day Jacob who is now in his 90s. Every few chapters, the story skips back to present day, and the nursing home-bound narrator. I felt the story would have worked a lot better if it had just stuck to the circus part of the story. The present day interjections were distracting. Other than that, this was an excellent book. Highly recommended.",5,"A vet, an elephant, and a girl",1163030400,"11 9, 2006"

ASE8NX3F8TIJR,0002007770,Chris Bowen,2,2,"Fantastic read.  I flew straight through it in just a few intense sessions, eyes locked to the page over an hour at a time.  Couple of quick book comparisons immediately come to mind.  First, I'm reminded of the great line near the beginning of ""Life of Pi"", that informs the reader that they are about to hear a story that will make them believe in God.  I wrapped myself around that line and read in hopes of the book keeping that promise.  It's a bold promise, so I reward the book for its effort, but I'm not sure it lead to any true converts.  We get a similar sentiment in the beginning of ""Water for Elephants.""  Jacob pulls us in by insinuating that he's about to tell us a secret he's kept for over seventy years.  Again, I found myself lured into the book's ""Big Top"" to find that secret.  And much like an old-world carnival, I found my main attraction and enjoyed all of the book's turns and sideshows.Another book comparison that comes to mind is with ""Iron Weed,"" a Pulitzer Prize winner in the eighties.  Like, ""Iron Weed,"" this book does really an excellent job of submersing you in the feel and sense of being flat broke and in dire straights, trying to negotiate survival during the Great Depression. During a long stretch inside the world the book creates, I could literally feel the dust and dirt being kicked up by the roustabouts and workers, as the tents went up.  Gruen took my into those crammed, dirty box cars, and murky late-night binges.  I was there.One more favorite from the book.  The author somehow manages to make the internal world of a ninety or ninety-three year old man, trapped and forgotten in a nursing home, just about as interesting as the glitz and glamor of the show and the drama it unfolds.  That's no easy feat, but she does it well.  I was left thinking about aging, long after I had let go of the circus.  Jacob's thoughts about how senility sort of creeps in and his explanations of his two worlds, and no longer being sure where one ends and the other begins, stayed with me.

A2UUWXO7QKOHMU,0002007770,Chris,1,3,"Water for Elephants has its good moments (a particular incident late in the book, during which the protagonist is standing over a sleeping but dangerous man with knife in hand trying to decide what to do next is hauntingly poignant), but all told, I'm glad that I read this book through the Kindle leasing program rather than buying it.There are several themes in Water for Elephants, including the lack of dignity often associated with the treatment of the elderly and the evil effects of greed. However, the backbone of the story seems to be a sort of iconoclasm. The Sterling images of the circus often inculcated in us during childhood are challenged by images of violence, animal cruelty, and graphic sexuality. However, the fact that this book unearths the dark side of the early twentieth century circus speaks less to its quality than to the fact that our society all too often allows commercialism and popular mythology to shape our images of the past. Simply challenging false notions held by society contributes very little to the value of a story like this one. In the end, the tone of the book takes on moods which can change violently from the darkly cynical to the unrealistically optimistic (the ending of the book feels impossible, illegal, and unsafe). Sentimentality, rather than a meaningful exploration of human emotion, dominates the scenes of the assisted living facility, although as noted above, the fact that those scenes also bring to light the continuing need for respect to the elderly does serve to redeem them to a decent extent.The story is, on some level, a ""forbidden romance"", and on this level, it has many failings. The rapidity with which Marlena falls for Jacob seems more indicative of a woman torn by the violent nature of her relationship than a woman in anything approaching love. The way in which August is killed seems to do nothing but Grant a legitimacy to the relationship via Pacidermis ex Machina, and to tie up loose ends.All in all, this isn't an awful book, but it seems to be the type of story commonly found in book discussion groups for all of two months before being rapidly forgotten. There is no real draw, beyond a handful of tense and well-written moments in the last quarter of the story.For the Kindle edition, images work surprisingly well, and I have no real complaints about formatting.",2,A New York Times Bestseller Unlikely To Stand The Test Of Time,1359158400,"01 26, 2013"

It is evident that Gruen painstakingly researched life in the 1930's circuis, and her hard work paid off with a nice slice of Americana.  The book's plot kept me turning pages late into the night.Others have complained about the book's vulgarity, and I'll admit that several scenes were a bit too vulgar for my taste, but the subject is the depression-era circus, not nursery school.  While not necessarily pleasant, it was probably befitting the subject matter.The greatest praise I'll give Gruen was in her ending.  The fiction-literature authors of the last decade seem to be of the notion that a depressing ending makes for good literature.  I would like to remind these authors that I read fiction as an escape from reality, not as a desire to have more of it.

I quite enjoyed reading from the old man's perspective, as it was full of complex emotions and a fascinating struggle with old age and all the restrictions and handicaps that come with it.  However, the segments of the story dealing with the young man were actually not as intriguing for me.  While they had an exciting plot, I felt these parts were not as well written, mainly because the main character's voice wasn't terribly authentic as a young man, and certainly wasn't as revealing as the old man's chapters.  However, because one alternates between a fascinating character and an exciting plot, it is difficult to put the book down, as you don't want to miss the next plot development, or the next revealing bit about the old man.Some may read this book as it will soon be coming out as a movie starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon, but I'd like to advise any mothers to beware of buying the book for their young daughters, as there are some shockingly racy bits in there--FAR more graphic than the Twilight saga.",4,Entertaining read,1297036800,"02 7, 2011"

I read this for a book club; I'd never have chosen it for myself and was the only person to not enjoy the book. While I skimmed much of the circus part, I found myself enjoying the here-and-now part with Jacob in the nursing home.He was the type of character I enjoy, with his ornery comments and the loss he endured. Not necessarily with the death of his beloved wife, but with the forgetfulness of his surviving family, his children and grandchildren. It was almost as if he was an afterthought once he was in the Home - out of sight out of mind. That was heartbreaking, and I could see why he chose the end he did - to run away and spend the last bit of his life doing something he could, where people needed him and wouldn't forget him.The young Jacob's life - eh. He was weak, not very bright and I question how he managed to get into an Ivy League school. But then they don't test you on common sense. There was no real consequence for his actions in the circus, and he managed (drunk death defying feats on a moving train notwithstanding) to consistently escape his actions.I admit to not guessing the entire ending, though it was obvious who his wife was since her introduction. The writing was full of flowery clich&eacute;s, and there were several places I wish Ms. Gruen would've gone over again to plug up some holes and take out excessive details, but overall it did work.

A36RQXIACCVSGN,0002007770,Christopher D. Galeone,1,1,"""Water for Elephants"" by Sara Gruen is a well written, depression-era book, that most readers ages 15-95 could read and enjoy even if you think this isn't the typical type of book you would read.This book tells two stories simultaneously as a 93 yr. old crumudgeon embittered by his surroundings in a retirement home recollects his life as he travelled with a second-rate circus while falling in love with a married woman.I probably would have never read this book had it not been for a family book club (Isn't that why you have them), however I'm sure glad I did, I really did enjoy this read and found the pages turned much quicker than I anticipated.I always am interested to see how an author can write in the point-of-view pf the opposite sex and I thought it was executed wonderfully. Also, the terminology that was used was very specific to the time and to how the circus-folk spoke at the time. One could tell Gruen definately did her homework.If there is any drawback it would be the end to one of the stories (I'm not going to say which one or how it ends don't worry). I thought it ended kind of sappy and a little unbeleivable for a story that seems very factual.Bottom line, four stars. I am very stingy with my stars, so please read and enjoy.",4,"Even if this isn't your typical read, you will enjoy.",1222992000,"10 3, 2008"

The author toggled between the the main character's current situation (lonely and crabby as a 90-something in a rest home), and 1931, when he was 23 and working for a traveling train circus. I was greatly enthralled with the 1931 chapters, and boringly depressed with the rest home chapters. For me, the train kept derailing at the rest home.My other complaint (minor, albeit), is that some modern views may have been infused into 1931, which strike me as anachronistic. For instance, the main bad guy hits his wife. The main character complained to the boss that the wife should leave her husband, saying ""He HIT her."" Nowadays, that's how people would talk about it, and it would be justification for the wife leaving the bad guy. But in 1931, that would likely not be brought up.Other than that, this was one of the most unusual and interesting books I've ever read. I've never encountered a story like this.

The clowns and the ittle people.  I enjoyed recreating those memories while reading this delightful and sweet account of two circus runaways who fall in love.  Their story was predictable in so many ways.  The old Jacob part was just sad and it left a sour feeling.  However, I did enjoy reading about the circus people and their lives.

Through Jacob we get a glimpse behind the scenes of the the characters, relationships, struggles, and class warfare of circus folk.  Intertwined in this interesting story of the circus is a love story.  I noticed that one of the other reviewers found the love story a bit trite, but I disagree.

It's rare that I read a novel and become so engulfed with the story, but from the first page, I was hooked. The way in which Gruen has the protagonist of the story, Jacob Jankowski, switch back and forth between his 22-year-old self and present day 90 (or 93) year-old self is both creative and effective in capturing her readers. Every single scene has intensity and vibrancy. The juxtaposition of the elderly Jankowski and the young circus worker Jankowski posed a humorous yet almost sad setting for the story. Readers would be crazy not to fall in love with his character.Though fiction, the novel represents the lives of circus workers back in the 1920's and 1930's and gives insight to the gruesome conditions the men had to live in, and the constant struggles that they faced everyday. Each chapter begins with a photograph derived from circuses back from the time Jankowski would have worked. The photos truly show the lives that these men led and let readers see not only imagine how things were. Though the historical value of the novel was fascinating, the forbidden but passionate relationship between Marlena and Jacob was the most captivating portion. The constant secrecy from August and the fear of being revealed created an incredible emotional reaction for me.The corruption of the novel and the intensity of the characters made this novel a hard one to dislike.

From page 1 of the prologue, she had captured my full attention with vivid imagery and intriguing characters. When you read great historical fiction like this, it's hard not to get sucked into the world and time of the characters. Water for Elephants does this to perfection--my mind was transported back to Depression-era America, as I traveled on a train-circus, mingling with performers and working-men alike. It was a fun and fantastical adventure.Gruen's story, gritty at times and uplifting at others, is compelling to say the least--I never wanted to set this book down! I thought the author's technique of transporting the reader back and forth between Jacob's time with the Benzini Brothers and his later years spent at the nursing home was done magnificently.

A1T17LMQABMBN5,0002007770,CoffeeGurl,3,4,"Jacob Jankowski is ninety years old -- or maybe he's ninety-three; he doesn't remember.  However, he does remember a very interesting part of his life.  It comes about one day when the news that a circus is in town and one of Jacob's fellow nursing home inmates brags about having worked at a circus and giving water to the elephants.  Jacob knows the old man is full of it.  After all, Jacob once worked at a circus.  Rewind seventy-something years, to the 1930s, amid the Great Depression.  Jacob is twenty-three, just weeks away from getting his degree in Cornwall University to become a certified veterinarian.  Then he receives the news that his parents died in a terrible accident.  He also discovers that they had no money -- they had invested every last penny on Jacob's Ivy League education.  Distraught, Jacob runs away.  By accident, he ends up on a train, destination unknown.  He discovers that the train is actually one that carries a traveling circus.  One thing leads to another, and he ends up working as a sort of unofficial caretaker for the animals.  He meets August and his wife Marlena.  Jacob learns many secrets to life as a circus performer and worker, meets lots of interesting people, and encounters some very unsavory things.  August, for instance, is a very unstable, unpredictable person.  He is abusive to the animals and insufferable one moment, and completely charming and obliging the next.  The way he treats the animals, especially Rosie, the new performing elephant, makes Jacob sick, but he can't do anything about it.  The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth has its awful moments, but things get worse for Jacob when he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena...I like the way Water for Elephants changes from Jacob's present-day narrative as a cynical old man with early signs of dementia to his days as a nave young man and his struggles with wanting to fit into the Benzini Brothers and wanting to lose his virginity.  The way his voice and narrative change is clear and precise and you get drawn into this unique and at times quirky novel.  The backdrop of the Depression is wonderful and believable.  The secondary characters are compelling, especially Walter, August, Uncle Al and Marlena.  August is a horrible person, and the scenes centered on his abuse toward Rosie the elephant are indeed sickening.  It's a good thing Gruen spares us from too much information in terms of the actual abuse.  Rosie sounds adorable and I loved it when she was in the scenes.  I very much enjoyed Water for Elephants.  It's very moving and entertaining.  No wonder it became a #1 New York Times bestseller!  Even though the NYT list has never influenced my reading, especially since the stuff that makes the top list is mostly trash, it's nice to see that readers get it right every once in a while.  Sara Gruen is a great author.  I look forward to reading her future works.",4,The real show happens offstage...,1216425600,"07 19, 2008"

You must become so invested in the daily life and fate of the characters that you become more interested in what is happening on the page than what is going on in your life. At its sporadic best, this novel is a good read. The author has chosen an interesting world and time to write about and obviously done her homework. But homework is not enough. The great nagging problems however are she is neither a good nor original writer. Consequently the characters she has created are wooden and every third sentence out of their mouths is either predictable or a howling cliche. The characters themselves are comprised of one cliche after the other-- the good hearted innocent hero, the evil boss, the plucky sidekick (a dwarf, no less),the bewitching damsel in distress, the schizo villain who is mean to animals... You've seen them all too many times before in books, movies, even cartoons. So when they meet their fates you shrug because you guessed what would happen to each of them fifty pages(or more) before.

When she finally showed, her personality was not developed like I wanted it to be.  It really was lacking.  There were bits and pieces but the animal was by no means the star of this book as advertised.The other thing that bothered me about this book were the very explicit sex scenes that I was not ready for at all.  I had no idea these were in the book.  I don't know if any reviewers wrote about that but next time I will read more reviews before getting any book.  Now I'm stuck with it on my device.  I archived it but I would like to completely delete it and haven't figured out if that's even possible.  It doesn't seem to be, from all I've read.

I decided to pick up the mass market paperback, not sure if I want to see the movie since Reese Witherspoon is in it and I don't like her at all.  Can't comment on Robert Pattinson's acting other than the Twilight movies, but thought I could get an idea of what he would be like in the movie based upon his character.  I am almost finished with the book and am still waiting for something interesting to happen.  Decided to look at the reviews to see if I was missing anything.  The one stars seem to match my opinion so far.  None of these characters seem to have any depth, especially the protagonist.  Maybe the nurses and definitely Greg, who someone else mentioned, because he seemed to be the smartest one in the scheme of things by figuring out a way to communicate with the elephant.  I can't say I like anyone in this book or really care what happens to any of them.  Camel isn't even a sympathetic character, maybe he will have some purpose, but just seems to be an annoying filler at the moment.  Even the descriptions of the performances with the elephant and the horses was boring.  I guess I will muddle along even though I feel like I'm wasting my time.  I assume what's her name gets away with murder, so to speak, but if that's the case, the most exciting part of the book was the beginning.

A3PPJKMEQWJNI5,0002007770,Coraline,1,2,"I feel a little weird writing a critical review about this book. It was strongly recommended to me by several people who said it was ""a great story"" so I was expecting something that would truly captivate me and pull me in. For me, it simply fell short.I think that a tremendous amount of time and effort went into the research involved for this book and that should not go unnoticed. If you're looking for a book that clearly depicts the Great Depression and/or circus life during that time period - by all means you should pick up the book. I do not know a tremendous amount about that time period to tell you if it was fully accurate, but I feel that it did give me a pretty good picture of what circus life would be like in that era. The photographs installed at the beginning of each chapter also did a great job connecting the story with the reality of traveling circuses of the time. The language probably could have corresponded a bit more, but in terms of the spirit and energy of the book versus the time period in which it takes place, I think it was pretty spot on.However, I really had trouble connecting with the characters. They simply did not seem like well-rounded, real people to me. I understand that the characters should be eccentric considering they are individuals traveling with a circus, but not to the point where they should seem artificial. Their emotional reactions to various tumultuous situations seemed unrealistic - based on having experienced similar situations in my life. The psychological repercussions would have been huge for a lot of the major conflicts that occur in the book - especially during the time of the Great Depression - but I did not feel the degree of inner struggle within the characters was well represented throughout the story. The characters would get sad or angry, but they seemed to sedate their feelings pretty darn quick.The depiction of the main character in his old age, however, seemed more realistic to me. I thought the scenes in the nursing home were very well done and true to life. The characters in these parts also seemed more believable to me. However, I was pretty disappointed in the ending. It seemed contrived. I will not get into it too deeply, however, so as not to spoil the story.I genuinely feel that Sara Gruen is a great author and did a good job with the book, I just feel that the character development was lacking. In terms of painting a picture of the environment though, she did a fantastic job and it's a book worth reading, if only for the descriptive element of it.

Her writing style is great and kept my attention. I was wanted to know what happened next. The main character was great. He was a very frustated old man who didnt know where his youth went along with his flashbacks of actually working the circus. The circus as we know always has their share of secrets and such and this gives you some insight. Some of the reviews on this book are very judgemental cause either they didnt like the book or that it does or can start off slow if you dont pay attention to detail. I love the main characters comments cause they remind me so much of my grandfather and him being stubborn in the nursing home. Its a very relatable book.

A39AWL2FKWDFK6,0002007770,Cory D. Slipman,6,7,"Sara Gruen's engaging novel ""Water for Elephants"" is a well researched and cleverly formatted reminiscence of one Jacob Jankowski, a 93 or 90 year old (he can't remember which) assisted living inhabitant.  Jankowski, still in possesion of his faculties, had worked in circuses for many years and this novel is a flashback to his life at that time.  Gruen spins her story alternating chapters of Jankowski's past and present.Jankowski had been an enthusiastic veterinary student at prestigious Cornell university.  Days before sitting for his final exams, he shockingly learns that his parents had been killed in an tragic auto accident.  To his dismay, he stunningly learns that due to the economic downturn of the Great Depression, his father's veterinary business and whole estate is essentially worthless.  His parents mortgaged everything to pay for his education.Distraught and penniless, Jankowski aimlessly wanders from the Cornell campus, eventually hitching a ride, hobo style on a train that was home to the Benzini Brothers circus.  Mentored by a alcoholic but kindly circus worker named Camel, he starts working caring for the animals in what was known as the menagerie.  He will assume the duties of a true vet and work under the schizophrenic equestrian director August.  Augie is married to celebrated equestrian performer Marlena, who Jankowski falls deeply in love with.""Water for Elephants"" is essentially a look back into the 3 1/2 months that Jankowski worked in the circus revealing the seamier underbelly of circus life from the side unseen by the ""rubes""  or circus-goers.

A51IK68MWKV5R,0002007770,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""",5,8,"I hesitate to slap a derisive label like ""chick lit"" on anything, but author Sara Gruen's third novel is a prime example of the worst kind of ""women's fiction""; Water for Elephants was obviously written by a woman solely for other women, with no attempt to be realistic from the male point of view. Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him ""unshaven"" with the implication that what he really means is ""unclean,"" you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and ""chick flicks"" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a ""twist"" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, ""Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it! Now downstake it!""

AUPS99MM70UHD,0002007770,Craig Keller,49,59,"I rarely pick up best-sellers, but I felt compelled to torture myself through this one after Gruen was awarded -- in a baffling but sickeningly telling example of how lowest-common-denominator and bottom-line the book publishing business has become -- $5 million for her next two, as yet un-penned books. I've got $10 that says they involve touchy-feely maudlin interaction between people and animals and cliched romanctic treacle. I wouldn't be shocked to see a unicorn rear its head.This novel is cliche and a pastiche of formula coopted from other, better books from cover to cover. The dialogue is PAINFUL. Every line feels prepackaged for the movie studio executive Gruen undoubtedly set out to placate before writing one word. Worse, while characters speak in cliched colloquial style, it remains ONE style. There is little to distinguish one voice from another. The plot, too, proceeds along a rote path -- I was predicting nearly every turn of it paragraphs, and then pages, ahead of time.Gruen is justly commended for her research into circus history, which is the only original element she brings to the table. She clearly delights in it, though even that reads like dutiful observations culled from a torrent of microfiche and historical society archives. It's clear Gruen has spent a lot of time with her nose in books, and derives her style, such as it is, from other sources -- most notably, and unforgivably, William Styron's ""Sophie's Choice,"" from which she shamelessly pilfers the very specific dynamics of that novel's central ill-fated love triangle, around which all else revolves. Gruen's Nathan is an equestrian director named August (interesting to note there are six letters in each name), and he's a Jewish paranoid schizophrenic. When Gruen's protoganist -- surprise! a young, precocious, naive but quickly maturing lover-boy bred from earnest all-American stock -- finds himself caught between the couple (Sophie is renamed Marlena here), all hell breaks loose (""all hell breaks loose"" incidentally is a cliched phrase that appears several times throughout the book -- consider my usage a wry homage).Do yourself a favor and buy the original, not the infantile copy.",2,Sara Gruen owes William Styron some royalties,1185408000,"07 26, 2007"

I am unable to comment on all the details that made this book highly enjoyable, but nonetheless I wanted to add my review.One of the first things that piqued my interest was the fact that the main character was 93-years old (or was it 90?) which lent a different perspective to the storyline and resolution.  Jaocb, was a very likeable main character in his old age and in his youth, but was not the only character you felt invested in. The character of Walter (Kinko) with this dog Queenie was just as intriguing despite his secondary role in the story.  As well, the antagonist, August, was just as aptly developed, which made you fear his anger towards Marlena and Rosie.  Speaking of Rosie, as an animal-lover, I cared deeply for her safety and sucess in the future of the circus.I was surprised to find out that the author knew very little about the circus prior to writing this book, but she did an excellent job of researching to pull off a very believable background/setting for this story.The characters live with you long after the story is over and you find yourself wondering what happened to Mr. Jacob Jankowski as he started on a new adventure in his life at 93 (or was it 90?).",5,Best book I've read this year!,1300492800,"03 19, 2011"

AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,0002007770,Crystal Starr Light,0,0,"""Is where you're from the place you're leaving or where you have roots?""Jacob Jankowski is a young man, studying to be a vet at Cornell. When both of his parents die in a car accident, Jacob is so torn up, he runs away in the middle of his final exams and joins up on a circus train, the Benzini Brothers' Most Spectacular Show on Earth. His life in the Depression era on a traveling circus are intercut with the present day, 90-something year old Jacob reminiscing about the past and dealing with one of the most difficult obstacles: life.I Liked:With the movie due to appear in theaters soon and the recommendation from a friend, I decided to hunt down an audiobook and listen. And, in short, am I glad.Before I started reading, I thought (based on either the blurb on the back cover and the movie trailer) that the book was a love story dressed up in circus costumes in the vein of James Cameron's ""Titanic"". Poor boy meets wealthy attached (married) girl, both fall in love, blah, blah, blah. Throw in some random animals, circus acts, and there you go.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't the case. The characters were beautifully drawn and real, from our protagonist and narrator, Jacob, to his bunkmate, Kinko/Walter, to our love interest, Marlena, to our antagonist, Big Al. The story focuses more on the circus life than on the love between Marlena and Jacob. The setting was beautiful and intricate, the ambience was spectacular and grotesque (sometimes at the same time!), and I truly felt transported back into the past. Not to mention, there were many tearjerker moments--real, emotional moments, not those written just to elicit a pornographic emotional response.Jacob was a good narrator. I felt his pain as his parents died, I understood his awe at Rosie, I felt his disgust at August's disgusting behavior. But my favorite character was Marlena, and I can definitely see why Reese Witherspoon was cast as her. She is spunky, fun, mature, and spirited. My heart broke hearing how her family abandoned her just because she married a Jew (she was Catholic), and I hated how August treated her. Walter was also another great character. It was terrible how his mother basically sold him to the circus just because of his dwarfism. And the scene where he almost loses Queenie really brought home how alone and lonely this poor guy was.So many novels these days seem to be window dressing for a love story, but this novel isn't one of them. Sure, a cornerstone of the novel is about Marlena and Jacob, but there is much more going on. A man's journey into coping with death. The horrors of the circus. How hard life was back in the Depression. Escapism. The trials of growing older. The need to belong. The story deftly wove back and forth between younger and older Jacob, and I found myself interested in BOTH sides, not just one or the other.I Didn't Like:In places, the novel is very graphic. I didn't care for when Jacob barged in on someone AHEMing or hearing about the two ladies AHEMing Jacob.I would have liked to have seen a little more of the acts that went on in the circus, though I suppose those would work better in a visual medium.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:A few f-bombs, amongst milder profanities.Jacob is interested in losing his virginity. While drunk, two women try to perform sexual acts on him, but Jacob vomits on one. Two characters make love; ""self love"" is shown once or twice.The story opens with a character about to be impaled. Camel is crippled because of his drinking. August is abusive to his animals and to others. Workers have been thrown off the train, a practice called ""red lighting"".Overall:This is an impressive book, one that totally bucked all my prejudices and preconceived notions. It was able to do what a lot of books can't: make me care about the characters and take me to another ""world"". I only hope that the movie, when it comes out, can do it justice.

This is perhaps the most extraordinary novel I've read in literally years, from an author with truly AWESOME talent.  Generally, I read almost nothing but mystery novels...and ones with ""hard-bitten"" heroes, at that...not even a hint of anything sniveling.  I'm just not a touchie-feelie kind of girl.  So if a feel-good book like this can affect me so enormously, just think what it'll do for those of you who like this kind of stuff!  Only partly joking here; but truly, this is one magnificent work of literary art.  Inside glimpses of life in a 1930's circus are so intimately written and ring so true, that it's hard to believe Ms. Gruen isn't 90 years old, writing memoirs.  Each character is so artfully rendered that you care, and care deeply!, about every single one of them.  You love them or hate them, with equal measures of intensity.  Add the super special treat at the beginning of most chapters of real photos from these old circuses, and you have just a jewel of a book.  Obviously, I'm drooling all over myself in this review, but I can't recommend it strongly enough, to everyone, no matter your preferences in reading material.  I took a chance and am SO glad I did.

AGZK126DNQ2FN,0002007770,"Cy B. Hilterman ""Cy. Hilterman""",0,1,"What a delightful read!  Water for Elephants has got to be one of the best reads for anyone that likes animals, circuses, and a very wonderfully flowing story.  Working in or for a circus, especially in past years, had to be one of the most grueling and tough jobs to tackle.  Sara Gruen makes the reader smell the circus smells, taste the midway foods, and be in the ring with the animals as they entertain.  I have not been to a circus since I was a teenager, which is MANY years ago.  Water for Elephants took me back to those days reminding me of some of the things I saw and smelled.His family placed Jacob Jankowski in a home for old folks because none of them wanted to ""have"" to take care of him.  Sad, but true.  Jacob is not sure if he is ninety or ninety-three years of age.  He only knows his age is somewhere around that range.  Jacob hates the other old people in the home, hates the food, and hates the nurses that treat him like he does not know what he is doing or saying.  This is no life for Jacob Jankowski!The story then goes back to when Jacob was in Cornell College studying to be a veterinarian.  He was shy about women; wanted nothing to do with them socially.  Jacob thought he must be the worlds oldest male virgin.  Jacob does well with his schooling until one day he was called out of class and told that both of his parents had been killed in an automobile accident.  Jacob, of course, was crushed, mentally and physically.  This couldn't be happening to him.  His parents had been paying his way through college so he figured he could continue his education with whatever his parents left him.  His father was also a veterinarian with a good practice.  Jacob was beside himself when he was told that all the property his parents owned was being taken because of no funds to pay for the bills.  It turns out that his father bartered with his customers as they paid him in chickens, eggs, animals, or whatever they had, but not money.This upset Jacob so much that he just took off walking and walking until he came to a rail track that had a train moving that he was going to jump on regardless of where it was going.  Thus Jacob began his circus life when he jumped that train and met other circus performers and roustabouts.  He had no idea what lie ahead.  His inclusion into the circus life was difficult, as the circus does not like young rubes being around experienced circus people.  When they found out he was ""almost"" a veterinarian, they were elated, as they had no one to medically care for the animals.  This gave Jacob a ticket into circus life.As I said originally, the author makes you feel as though you were in the circus troupe as they raised their tents, did their shows, ate the food available, got paid when there was money, running away from the law when one or more in the circus caused a problem with the law or local authorities, traveled on the circus train never knowing for sure where they would end up, putting up with the circus owner and top management that treated most of the help like dirt.Of course there was much in the book about personal lives of the circus employees and owners.  Also how the circus obtained more animals and equipment legally or otherwise.  It is an eye opener for anyone to read.  It makes one wonder how these circus people existed in those days of traveling and living such an uncertain existence.The story does occasionally go back to Jacob in the home in which he is so unhappy.  The circus comes to town and sets up right next to the home, making Jacob so excited to be so close to the circus, even though it is not one of the ones he worked when younger.  The days passed so slowly as he waited for his family to come and take him to his big visit to the big top.I doubt anyone could read this book without coming away with a great understanding of those old circus days and what they meant to the people that worked that hard life.  You will know that Sara Gruen put much time and effort in her research for Water for Elephants.  You WILL enjoy this book.  It will entertain you and educate you at the same time.",5,A story not to be missed,1186099200,"08 3, 2007"

A39ABKRS1MKFTW,0002007770,Cynthia K. Robertson,362,394,"Although it is only April, I predict that Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen will be one of the best books I read this year.  Gruen has proven to be an amazing storyteller.Water for Elephants is told in the first person but from two different perspectives--Jacob Jankowski at 23 years of age and again, at 93 years old.  Gruen seamlessly weaves the chapters between past and present.  Jacob at 23 is finishing up his last semester at Cornell Veterinary School when a family tragedy causes him to flee.  He finds himself on a train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in 1931.  Needing a vet, the circus hires young Jacob to tend to their menagerie.  Jacob at 93 resides in a nursing home where he laments the curses of old age, the passing of his wife, and the waning affection of his family.  The arrival of a visiting circus triggers a flashback to his youthful circus experiences.1931 is a hard time for almost all Americans, and the circus workers are as hard hit as any.  Most are one step away from being homeless and jobless.  Conditions on the circus train are harsh for most.  Many workers go weeks without being paid, and they tend to disappear during the night when times are tough (management has them thrown off the train).  The menagerie is often times treated better than the workers.  But the circus does provide three meals a day and a place to sleep--even it if might mean a horse blanket on a train bed floor.  Jacob discovers very quickly that he's just about the only advocate the animals have and he must battle a ruthless owner (Uncle Al) and a crazy animal trainer (August).Any circus has more than their fair share of interesting characters, and Gruen's circus is no exception.  In addition to Uncle Al and August, there is Walter (the midget clown), Marlena (an equestrian with whom Jacob falls in love), and Grady and Camel (workers).  One of the most sympathetic characters in Water for Elephants is Rosie, the elephant--who shares more ""human"" characteristics and feelings than some of the circus bosses.  The tender-hearted Jacob quickly grows to manhood as he is forced to protect both animals and coworkers from abuse and worse.Water for Elephants is a delightful, moving book, and the ending was a very pleasant surprise.  Also, if you want a special treat, listen to it on audiobook.  The two readers, David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones, did a wonderful job of bringing both Jacobs (young and old) to life.",5,One of the best books I've read this year...,1176854400,"04 18, 2007"

AETMW32J8CZJU,0002007770,C. Young,2,3,"Sometimes, a reader's expectations can greatly influence how she or he views a book.  With a name like ""Water for Elephants"", and a historical background as interesting as the Great Depression, I had expected to read a book about the difficulties of the circus life and how the historical backdrop influenced these characters' lives.  What I got instead was a sentimental love story dressed in the glitz of a historical novel, a slightly better-written version of a Nicholas Sparks novel.At the start of the book, the circus has just come to town; and that effectively got our querulous 93-year-old narrator to start reminiscing about the good old days when he used to travel with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth as a veterinarian.  As it turned out, 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski was one exam away from getting his veterinarian's degree from Cornell when both of his parents were killed in an automobile accident.  After having handled all of his parents' affairs, and after having found out that he's now virtually penniless, the grief-stricken young man walked out of his class room and hopped on the first train that crossed his path, a train that turned out to be the circus train owned by a ruthless circus owner, Big Al.  For the next 3 1/2 months, Jacob travelled with the circus as a veterinarian, taking care of the animals in the manegerie during the day and traveling from city to city by night.  It was also during this time that he met Marlena, the cricus performer who turned out to be the love of his life, and her cruel but charismatic husband, August.  The three soon developed the kind of complicated relationship that any romance reader worth his/her salt will know how it's going to turn out.The greatest strenght of this book definitely lies in the author's portrayl of circus life as they were in the early 1930's.  With Big Al, August, and Walter the midget - the author has assembled a memorable cast of secondary characters that the readers will either love to hate or root for.  Walter, in particular, turns out to be a character with much more depth than initially meets the eye, and how his relationship with Jacob evolved and developed was one of the highlights of the book.  Equally interesting was Jacob's interactions with Rosie, a mischievous elephant that ended up being the catalyst for a key event that will change Jacob's life.  I've never been a fan of the circus, but reading about Rosie's antics made me want to grab a handful of peanuts and head to the zoo.Regrettably, our main protagonists in the featured love story aren't nearly as interesting as the secondary or even the animal characters in the book.  Jacob, in particular, has about as much personality as a gnat. Throughout the book, he was grouchy as a 93-year-old, and whiny and ineffectual as a 23-year-old.  Some of the atrocities committed against the members of the circus - all in the name of survival and profit - is heartbreaking.  And yet, other than to rant and spend time sulking and moping around in his stockcart, Jacob was useless when it comes to helping his friends or even taking fate into his own hands.  Ultimately, his life turned out the way he wanted it to not because of any initiative on his part, but pure luck.  Since the book was told in first person from Jacob's point of view, the character of Marlena was even more under-developed than Jacob.  All we know is that she's this beautiful girl in pink sequin that caught Jacob's eye the day he joined the circus and from then on he was lost. There certainly wasn't enough interaction between the two to make their romance remotely convincing.  And for a book whose central theme is the great forbidden romance between two people who met at the wrong time, this is a great failure.So, in summation, if you are expecting to read a meaty historical that provides insight to what the circus life was like back during the 1930's, skip the book.  If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks and looking for a sentimental love story to tide you over until his next publication, this may just be your cup of tea.",2,An interesting but ultimately disappointing read,1303084800,"04 18, 2011"

After learning my friend had a copy and my dad was currently reading it I decided it was time.This book as been billed as a love story within a circus however the love story does not really start until well after the half way point of the book, maybe even two-thirds of the way in. There are many stories happening all at once. The story of a lost boy trying to find his way, a coming of age story. The story of friendships and life long bonds. The story of an almost veterinarian finding his way in the crazy life of a train circus. And the story of love. With all these potential story lines happening at one time I found the author had a tendency to wrap them up rather simply by killing someone off leaving only the main characters to survive.While overall I did enjoy this book it was not as wonderfully fantastic as I was hoping it would be. Maybe my hopes were too high from all the rave reviews I have heard. But it just did not stand up to my expectations for this book. I will give the book 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Who would have thought the circus is as bureaucratic and complicated as the corporate world!  The glimpse into life on a traveling circus was an enlightening and refreshing backdrop from which to catapult some of the themes we all face in our daily lives.  This book narrates the life of Jacob Janowski, an aspiring vet who is left orphaned and hops aboard what he soon learns is a train belonging to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth!This book is full of hearty laughs and painful disappointments. You will fall in love with Jacob's relentless can-do attitude and his inherent affection and commitment towards those he grows to love.  Rosie the elephant will touch you in ways you cannot imagine.  There is a certain depth around the love that animals exude.  It is silent and unspoken yet so powerful.  Rosie is intelligent and caring and through her vigilant eyes and silent actions is a magnificent portrayal of loyalty and friendship.  Walter the clown is another character to whom I grew very attached.  He is the typical insecure cynic whose interior consists of nothing but a soft shell.  He embodies the spirit of change and devotion and camaraderie.  This incredible cast of characters makes this a book of overwhelming depth.`Water for Elephants' was a surprisingly poignant story that is brimming with emotion.  The characters are so authentic; their memory will remain with you well after the pages of this book have ended.  It was a truly unique and enjoyable read.  Highly recommended.",5,A Gem.

It was an incredible ride, and I'm not sure how to summarize it better than that.Gruen's descriptions are so apt one can smell the animals, the popcorn, the sawdust, and the sweat.

Anyone who ever went to a circus and played the games on the midway are rubes wanting to be thrilled, enchanted and take leave of reality for a day. The illusion lasts about as long as cloud of cotton candy. The inside story delves into the darker aspects of what makes the circus viable especially during the 1930's Depression era. The reader is introduced to a strict caste system from bosses to performers to roustabouts that determines one's position among a long train of characters. The practice of 'redlighting' is  particularly powerful, a Darwinian, survival of the fittest practice where the circus bosses have the used up roustabouts tossed from the train as excess baggage. Our hero is Jacob Jankowski that over the course of  only 3 1/2 months joins the circus. As a veternarian he does not fit into the caste system.

The book is an excellent, fun, read for those who enjoy a bit of history mixed into a ""coming of age"" story. The book is a real page turner, and the Kindle version includes an interesting discussion with the Gruen, which explains how and why she chose to write the novel.Some readers may be bothered by the blunt, gritty details of circus life (which includes animal cruelty) --- but these are necessary for Gruen to give a reasonably believable story about a prohibition era circus. Other readers may be bothered by how Gruen switches between the young circus vet version of Jacob to the older nursing home resident version of Jacob. However, Gruen doesn't switch narration that frequently and the excerpts put forth by the older version of Jacob add quite a bit of character to the story.A note to those who have/plan to see the movie: The movie is a reasonable portrayal of the book, however the movie removes a lot of the subtleties from the book, subtitles that are quite interesting.",5,A coming of age story steeped in the history of circus fun,1310774400,"07 16, 2011"

A1G0DH7UQ4ILS6,0002007770,Daniel Estes,0,0,"Water for Elephants is an engrossing story about life in an early 1930's, depression-era traveling circus, but is also about so much more. Jacob Jankowski is presently ninety or ninety-three (he doesn't recall) and living out the end of his life in a nursing home. He has family who visit, but they are busy enough with their own lives that he is largely forgotten. A circus comes to town and Jacob thinks back on his own youthful experiences.I appreciate the story's realistic portrayal of early 20th century circus life. The animals live and work in conditions that are horrific, but at the same time they are the lifeblood of the show next to the human performers and are therefore treated well enough to that extent. The author, Sara Gruen, mentions in an interview that many of the anecdotes in the tale are plucked from real life accounts.

These are in no particular order:  an easy read, compelling and page turning story, informative about a distinct topic, emotionally uplifting and a good message.  Many authors will tell you that last one is not what they strive to produce in a novel, but often there is something one can learn from the experience.  Sara Gruen does a wonderful job educating us about depression era circuses amidst a love story, and not necessarily between a young man and woman, but between the people and animals the protagonist encounters.  She writes so smoothly that makes it easy to get swallowed up in the story anxious to see more like sitting on the edge of your seat in a movie theater.  Instantly one connects with the characters and roots them on or cringes involuntarily as the story evolves.  The message?  I'll let you discover that as it is more fun to read it than for someone to tell you what it means and often, it means something different for different readers.

The first involves a young, depression-era  veterinarian who loses his parents in a car accident just days before taking his final exams. His father, also a vet, had mortgaged his practice to the hilt to pay for his son's Cornell education. At loose ends the boy hooks up with a circus.The second has to do with the same man, now a miserable nonagenarian confined to a senior citizens home. He gets into a ""fight"" with another old man who claims to have carried water for the elephants. You don't carry water for the elephants; you take the elephant to the water. One would think the first story would be more compelling since the circus is a world of its own with its own language and culture, but it's really the ninety-year-old who wins our hearts. His ""people"" come to see him every weekend, but he doesn't really know who they are; he doesn't remember if he's ninety or ninety-three. But he does remember the circus.The circus story is kind of hokey. Almost immediately the young vet, Jacob Jankowski, falls in love with Marlena, the star of the equestrian act. The problem is she's already married to the animal trainer, who just happens to be a paranoid schizophrenic. He's also insanely jealous. Then there's the elephant, Rosie, who only speaks Polish; Camel, an alcoholic  roustabout who helps Jacob get a job with the circus; and Kinko, the dwarf, who at first is an enemy of Jacob's but later befriends him when Jacob cures Kinko's dog Queenie of the trots. The book does come to life periodically when Sara Gruen uses real circus lore. For instance, Uncle Al, the circus owner, loves freaks. He takes the circus train on a wild ride when he has a chance to employ Charles Mansfield-Livingston, a man with a parasite twin growing out of his chest, whom he calls Chaz.Gruen also provides numerous real-life circus pictures, one of which is especially titillating. She got them from STEP RIGHT THIS WAY: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDWARD J. KELTY and WILD, WEIRD, AND WONDERFUL: THE AMERICAN CIRCUS AS SEEN BY F.W. GLASIER.Gruen keeps you turning pages, relying on a couple of suspense elements. Does Jacob get the girl, and does Jacob, the nonagenarian, get to see a circus one last time?  I had a bit of a problem with Gruen's ending.

There were actually two stories in one -- the first being an engaging tale of a distraught youth running away with the circus and finding his manhood, love and responsibility for others.  I found the narrative compelling and the characters worth caring about.The second story, embedded in the first (or is it the other way around) is that of an elderly man, growing weaker in body, who is still sharp enough to know that he's fading quickly.  His faculties are starting to have issues, but he, again, is smart and together enough to realize this as well.  His story of a strong, vibrant will trapped in a failing vehicle is incredibly poignant, and, if a writer were talented enough, could make for a captivating book on its own.The ""easy"", high-action story of the circus makes up most of the book, but is tempered very well by the internal musings and frustrations of the second.All in all, very satisfying and highly recommended.",4,Two Great Ideas in One,1261440000,"12 22, 2009"

After all, the book stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for over two years. So there is no shortage of opinions on the novel and the movie. I am not sure I have anything new to add, but I will offer my take on three of the most debated of the book vs. movie questions.Spoiler alert: Stop if you have not yet read the novel or seen the movie...The book: Uncle Al and August are two separate characters. The movie: The two are combined into August. Verdict: The movie got it right. Uncle Al is an under-developed character in the book. The movie gives us one villain who is more menacing, especially as portrayed by Christoph Waltz.The book: Marlena gets pregnant with Jacob's child. The movie: She does not. Verdict: The movie steered clear of the hackneyed device of having the woman in the pair of star-crossed lovers get pregnant.The book: We are taken back and forth in time from the present of the old Jacob to the past of the young Jacob. The movie: Scenes with Jacob as an old man bookend the story. Verdict: I have mixed feelings about this one. The passages focused on Jacob as an old man are poignant, insightful and empathetic. Some of the best storytelling on being old I have ever read. I would enjoy an entire book based on those passages. However, they interrupted the flow of the narrative and suspended the building tension of the story.",4,The Book or the Movie?,1326326400,"01 12, 2012"

The characters are wonderful, the depiction of an old time Circus and the life of those who were ""on the show"" is impressive.The book has two major flaws, in my opinion.  First, the beginning of the book is a word for word copy of the most tense and climactic scene, and the entire novel is spent just knowing you're headed to that scene, so all the power of that moment is spoiled.  A linear telling of the tale, start to finish, would have been much better.I'm not sure what was gained (if anything) by the dual voices of young and old narrator, but I suspect it was done for ""literary effect"".  This is a very powerful tale of romance, the bonds between men and animals, passion, love - every time it shifts back to the present - it's like a deflating balloon.I wish the story had been told on it's own without the unnecessary shifting of voice and had actually had a climax remaining when the climax arrived...I recommend the book, but lament some of the choices the author made in presenting it.",3,A Wonderful Story with a Flawed Delivery,1214179200,"06 23, 2008"
AAL7QMRIOAGVD,0002007770,"David Brockert ""constant reader""",0,0,"""Water for Elephants"" by Sara Gruen,  2006Ms. Gruen writes an odd story.  It is really two stories in one.  The main one is of an almost veterinarian, Jacob Jankowski, who becomes caught up in the life of a circus.  It is a romance: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back (whoopee).  In the afterword the author explains that she was wanting to do a story about the photographer of circus', but she got caught up in all the rest of the circus history and it became this book.  It is worthy and good.  The second is of the same man in a nursing home, or some such place, who sort of does not belong there.  He has lived his life and remembers it well.  The instigation is the circus has come to town!!The chapters are defined by when is the story being told.  Sometimes it is now: he is old and ornery; the next one, he is remembering his life in the circus.  The value is in the perspective: as an old man, he has problems, but he deals with them, somewhat; as a young man he grows up and finds the love of his life.  It is always wonderful to read a story of love growing and becoming the be all to end all.  But real love is of the animals, horses, elephants, orangutans, chimpanzees and doing something constructive.  In the end you feel that everything is wonderful and has come out all right.The odd thing, like in some other places I have seen (""Passenger 54""), the title comes from out of the blue, once, and it is never explained or spoken of again.",5,the life of a circus,1209168000,"04 26, 2008"

A12HI5D3C2EGWJ,0002007770,"David Edmonds ""tapestry100""",2,2,"An amazingly beautiful story, Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is the tale of Jacob Jankowski and the 3 months that he worked for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus. When we meet Jacob, he is in his 90s, living in a nursing home and reliving his days with the Benzini Brothers circus. It was through a chance encounter after the death of his parents that caused him to leave veterinary school and put his fate with the circus.I was really surprised by how quickly the story captured my attention. The novel jumps back and forth from ""now,"" where we see Jacob dealing with the trials of old age, and ""then,"" as he remembers his days with the Benzini Brothers circus, and how those days formed him into the man that he would grow to become. The sequences are fluid, though, and you find yourself easily swept along with the story. Sara Gruen's prose is amazing; I found myself on several occasions holding my breath, I was so wrapped up in the story. Gruen clearly portrays her characters emotions and captures each of their voices and personalities perfectly and her portrayal of the lives of the circus folk in the 1920s-30s was very grim. It was amazing to me that so many people would live that kind of life, but I guess when that was the only work to be had, they'd take what they could get.Gruen seems to have done her research as well. Even though the Benzini Brothers circus is fictitious, I think it was clearly influenced by any number of circus' in operation at the time. She also makes reference to several actual circus events (such as the Hartford Circus Fire of 1944 and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus train accident of 1918). Even down to the band playing ""The Stars and Stripes Forever"" during an emergency, Gruen seems to have done her homework on circus life.If you haven't read this yet, I'd really recommend it. I'd had the book on my shelf since it was released (I was caught up in the buzz, but never got around to actually reading it) and after 2 friends mentioned it a couple weeks back, I decided to take it off the shelf and give it a try.

AOGLOD55SNLD7,0002007770,"David Lupo ""David Lupo""",1,1,"""Water For Elephants"" is a human story, filled with the drama of raw human living. The cover invites you to step right up and look at the shadow side. The title is a subject that the narrator, Jacob, knows far more about than anyone else, having spent years on a circus train. So even the title points to the in-your-face flavor of the story. The characters walk into the story from the rough years of the Great Depression. They all point to the darker side of our nature, while they put on a show that denies the fact. Here we find true grit: the smell of alcohol; the sight of blood; the sound of rage; the feelings of frustration.The plot includes people who grit their teeth and bear the pain. Jacob becomes addicted to his pain through the years. August struggles with mental illness. Marlena presses on in a marriage she doesn't want. A dwarf ekes out a difficult living in a world of rejection. The big boss pushes on to maintain that his world is composed of ""suckers born every minute"". The animals too also bear hardship and abuse from supposed caretakers.The story is energized by a foretaste of rebellion against the oppressive power. This early glimpse kept me moving through the whole story. Note that this is not a happy story. You're not going to read Winnie the Pooh. Sara Gruen finds a silver thread of redemption in the midst of dark clouds in Jacob, albeit a painful thread. It sticks like a tattoo through the years, making Jacob what he is in his nineties, still swinging his fists at enemies long gone.

Gruen writes the most enjoyable kind of historical fiction, focused on a fascinating time and setting that the reader probably knew next to nothing about before starting the book. In this case, the scene is the American traveling circus of the early 1930's, just after the start of the Depression. The protagonist operates in two time periods, as a nonagenarian in a current day ""assisted living facility"" and flashing back to his days as a young veterinary student who due to circumstances beyond his control ends up serving as the vet for a traveling circus. Gruen intended to imagine various vignettes for the book, but in her research and interviews with circus veterans discovered stories from real life that were even better--a real-life case of truth being stranger than fiction. The assisted living facility is inevitably less interesting than the world of freaks and geeks in a circus, but Gruen handles the voice of the aged just as deftly as that of the young vet.  The book is enhanced by actual pictures from various circus archives. Not an especially profound book, ""Water For Elephants"" still gets a five-star rating for all readers for readability and Gruen's ability to evoke an interesting place and time so well, along with a surprising and touching, albeit a little far-fetched, ending.",5,Water for Elephants; Chocolate for Readers,1180656000,"06 1, 2007"

It transports readers to the depression years where able-bodied men wandered the country aimlessly looking for work and taking any menial job offered so they could eat. In Gruen's novel, a traveling circus prayed on the desperation of these men, used them, and then discarded them. The men in charge of this circus treated their performers, both human and animal, with slightly more care as long as they attracted rubes ... the gullible public. The story is told through the eyes of Jacob Jankowski, a ninety-year old man committed to a nursing home by his grown, also-aging children. He delves into his memory bank when a circus sets up nearby. His recollections of being a vet with the traveling circus are vivid, poignant, and disturbing. So are the scenes of Jacob's life in the nursing home. Gruen skillfully interweaves tales from his past with the present. She probes our conscience about care for our elderly and our animals.

For anyone who had this kind of wonder in their lives, you know what a blessing that was....and for those who didn't.....well my heart aches for your not knowing what you missed.  Watching and listening to; in particular, my Grand-dad E. was both heart breaking and fabulous!  His mind was sharp and exact till the end...even though sometimes his physical self didn't follow suit the way he thought it should.  Even with all of the frustration that came with getting older and losing control of parts of his life, he always had advice to give and stories to tell.  I would stay up at the barn with him all through the summer days, helping him work on his projects while he explained to me how to tell when a snake was venomous or showing me how to brush the horses out at the end of the day, because no matter how tired you where...they had worked harder.  I am filled with memories of sitting and listening to him telling tales of when he was in his 20's and 30's and what they all did to get by during the depression. He also made sure I knew how wonderful it was to get sit out in the field you'd been working in all day and eat your fill of the melons that were being harvested.

AO50Q84BKQ2WF,0002007770,Deacon Brodie,5,5,"There are so many things to rave about when it comes to Sara Gruen's novel.First it's a period piece (which I love) set in Depression-Era America that gets all of the details just right: it's gritty, truthful, and unsentimental, yet still fascinating and entertaining. I was amazed and enlightened by all of the details of an early-20th century circus and all of its inner workings.Secondly, the novel is told from two different perspectives.  One is a 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski, who is an ivy-leage educated animal doc and recently ""orphaned"", while the other perspective is a  90(or 93)-year-old Jacob, whose days are spent in a nursing home, longing for the days of his youth.  Both perspectives are equally compelling and entertaining, and they come together to reveal mysteries about the story in the end.Speaking of mysteries, I loved that there was a twist that totally caught me off guard in the end.  These always make for great pleasures if done right, and Gruen's  surprise delivers a punch at the end that I wasn't even looking for.I already am waiting for the mention of film rights to this one.  It screams movie all the way through.  Not just because of the amazing story and characters, but also for the potentially incredible set design, costume design, and stunning visuals.  The elderly Jacob would be a great role for someone in the winter of their years and the flashbacks between then and now just yearns to be filmed.Finally, the characters in this book sold me.  Every one of them is a real treat.  As you might imagine, the characters in a circus are, well, real characters, and those from The Benzini Brothers circus is no exception.  Jacob, upon accidentally joining this troupe, discovers real evil, unlikely friendships, and the love of his life.  The characters are not exaggerations or caricatures like another unnamed circus novel I have read.  These people are empathetic, realistic, funny, and fascinating creations you won't soon forget.Get a copy of this novcl today.

I will say that the circus atmosphere was conveyed with incredible, and apparently accurate, detail and I was impressed by that. I could see and even smell everything, and the book movingly conveyed how desperate times led to desperate people clinging to even the most degrading employment with a third rate circus.  However, the characters seemed to be straight out of a romance novel, with the exception of old(even he's not sure how old he is)Jacob, who was funny, disarming, feisty and touching -- whereas the young Jacob was pretty vanilla, too obviously a ""nice guy"" with little personality.  In contrast, Old Jacob's voice was so clear and true and I really cared about him;he was funny and sad, his memories bittersweet, his longings compelling.  I also liked (but who didn't?)Rosie the elephant, who had twice the personality of anyone else in the fleabag circus, with the exception perhaps of Walter, the dwarf.  The plot depended on coincidences that I had problems believing, and I found myself caring more about the animals (which I admit isn't unusual for me!) than I did about any of the people.  However, I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sentimental stories, who loves happy, pat endings, who doesn't necessarily want a book to convey great ideas, but who is touched more by the romance rather than the writing.  Those of you will, as have many others, it appears, love this book.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that, it's just that those kinds of books are simply not what I prefer to read.

August was cruel, sadistic and had violent mood swings.  None of these are symptoms of schizophrenia.  He did not hear voices, have complicated delusions, or an inability to keep touch with reality.  Unlike most unmedicated schizophenics, August had no trouble  thinking rationally or logically, on the contrary, he was in charge of a large section of the circus and exhibited fine organizational skills!The writer could simply have portrayed her character, August, as a jealous, violent man but instead she chose to advance the false stigma that people with schizophrenia are horribly cruel and violent or that they have a ""split"" personality. If only Gruen had researched psychiatry as well as she had the circus.I work with people who suffer from this disease.  While, without medication the patients delusions might possibly, rarely, lead them to do something violent, it's usually in relationship to fear associated with a delusion -- thinking a person is really an alien from outerspace, for example.  Never the sort of cold-blooded violence August engaged in.  August always knew exactly who or what he was hurting.When medicated, people with schizophrenia are actually less likely to commit violent acts than the general population.It's truly a shame when a popular book spreads stigma in this manner, the negative ripple effects go on and on.",1,Paranoid Schizophrenic?

A1WKQ94M45D8MG,0002007770,"Denise Crawford ""DC""",1,1,"Ninety-three-year-old Jacob Jankowski, an unhappy resident of a nursing home, reminisces about his life with the traveling train circus -- Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth -- during the Great Depression. In and out of a small town, usually an overnight, the performers and working men put on a show that involves animals, freaks (the dwarf and the fat lady), the clowns, and all manner of circus act entertainment including a tent just for ""gentlemen"" and other delights.Jacob's parents died just as he was about to write his final exams in veterinary school at Cornell University. Because of the hard economic times, his parents mortgaged everything to pay his tuition and thus he was left grief-stricken AND penniless. He ends up joining the Benzini Brothers by an accident of good timing and, because of his vet training, he ends up hired on to care for the horses and other animals. Along the way, the circus owner purchases an elephant named Rosie; she becomes a special part of this story.Author Sara Gruen weaves a tale of hooking the rubes into coming to the show, second-rate performances that managed to wow the audiences, boozy nights, in-fighting among those with the train, backbreaking work, and other fascinating details of the traveling circus. Jacob quickly assimilates into the hard life and makes the mistake of falling in love with Marlena, one of the performers who has a sadistic husband. Not only cruel to his wife, August also beats and mistreats the animals. What will become of Jacob and the rest of the members of this group of misfits, outcasts, and showmen?Readers will savor the story and applaud the somewhat maudlin ending. I read it quickly and found it very sweet and entertaining; recommended for teens and adults. Enjoy!Caveat: there are descriptions of mistreatment and abuse of animals in this book.

AN4H3R5DLPSAO,0002007770,"Dennis Klimko ""House Spouse""",4,5,"The arrival of the circus train and accompanying parade down Main Street USA are just a nostalgic memory for rural America today. During the Depression, the circus went a long way towards bringing a brief but welcome respite from the economic and social gloom enveloping the ""rubes"" that loved the big top. For the price of admission, they could forget the misery and pain of daily life in smalltown America. But the spectacular show of death defying acts, performing animals, clowns and freaks are just an illusion.  The glitz and glitter also hide the fact that life behind the curtain is no different than life outside the tent. Sara Gruen does a good job showing us the ecomomic realities of circus life in the thirties; staying one step ahead of its creditors, meeting payroll, profiting from the failure of competitors and the constant pressure of keeping employees and animals healthy and well fed. The romance that drives the plot may be the weakest part of the story. For me it developed too quickly,it's intensity implausable and contrived. But Ms. Gruen admirably ties all of the loose ends together for a very satisfying conclusion.",4,Life at the bottom of the big top,1151884800,"07 3, 2006"

A31COLPMK70RQT,0002007770,Derek,4,5,"No spoilersI picked up Water for Elephants on whim in the bookstore while waiting for another book to be mailed to me from an Amazon marketplace seller. It had been recommended to me both by Amazon and by people I know, but I never gave it much thought because I'm not really a fan of the circus, but having just finished it (in a day and half) I am very glad I picked it up.Others have summarized the book sufficiently, so I won't go there, but I will say that from the prologue to the last page, you are invested in this book and the characters and care what happens to them. The story is told by the main character in his nineties who is in a nursing home, looking back on his life and how he got to where he is. The prologue is of the climactic event in his life in the circus, and then the rest of the book alternates every few chapters between his first hand accounts in the present in the nursing home and his first hand accounts in the past as a youth in the circus. The scenes from the present in the nursing home force you to sympathize with a man whose body is old but who is mind is young and the struggles associated with such a circumstance, while the scenes from the past in the circus are a window into the past that show you who this man used to be.This book had a captivating beginning, and satisfying ending, but my only problem, and the singular reason I didn't give it five stars was that in the middle, the story was just a tad slow. However, don't let that discourage you from reading it because, as you can see from my title, that only warranted a half-star reduction from me because this really is a great read as a whole whether you love or hate the circus and I recommend it full-heartedly to lovers of a good story.PS: For a novel with a completely different plot, but with similar execution (telling the story by alternating between present and past) and a fantastic five-star story, try Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.",4,A 4.5 star book with only one tiny problem...,1177891200,"04 30, 2007"

A1DT70XSV8FUB5,0002007770,Digital Rights,2,2,"I have read a bunch of novels recently that kept me engrossed for the first 70-80% and then faded badly. Water for Elephants is worth reading right to the satisfying ending. It is very well paced and has interesting twists and all the characters seemed real to me.I had never considered the 1930's touring circus as a basis for writing a novel. Now I want to learn more about it. That's because Gruen does such a nice job describing it. The characters (and the animals!) are very human and I think she captures the time they lived in quite well. I am impressed that there are over 1000 reviews and still more coming for a book that's been out now for over 4 years. It speaks to some of the universal qualities that appealed to me and perhaps other readers. The lead character is interesting, he's human and he has reflected on a life well lead while  yearning for more. I see a little bit of my father in there!One thing I am always looking for is how well a writer can give voice to a character that is so different from him or herself.

The author conjured up images so sharp and clear that I often thought of the classic movie The Greatest Show on Earth (directed by Cecil B. DeMille). The characters were well-fleshed and it was obvious from the beginning who was the 'hero' and who was the 'villain', both vying for the beautiful heroine. And then there was a secondary story set in present day that was artfully woven among the vintage circus story. I really enjoyed this book.

I'll put it this way though, if you know nothing about the circus in the 30s (apparently), you will REALLY enjoy this book.  I personally loved it.  It's a great read, I liked the flip back and forth between the main character at a different time.  And regardless of the inaccuracies in the book, I figure the book is meant to read like an old man remembering his youth and the ""good ol' days"".

Overall, I liked the book.  I found the depiction of circus and railroad life during the depression very interesting.  It appeared that the author did some in depth research.  The flashback technique between the circus and the nursing home, however, left me flat.  I did not feel that the nursing home chapters were of the same quality as the circus chapters and frankly rushed through them to get back to the ""real"" story.  If anyone starts the book, however, keep going as the ending is well done.My disappointment in this book came from the author's handling of important thematic materials.  The scene was set for so many important (and universal) statements and the author simply threw them away.  So much could have been written about class structure, disability awareness, capitalism, fairness in advertising, care of the elderly, animal rights, etc. and nothing came forth.  There was no symbolism or connections to classic themes, and I sure missed the place where the main character was equated with the biblical Jacob.

One thing they all have in common is introducing us to a foreign or unfamiliar world, in this case the depression-era circus.  But those other two books have a depth of soul, and a more comprehensive world-view, than Water for Elephants.I was also disappointed with a big, loose thread in the plot, where Camel was to be reunited with his son and the reader was set for that pivotal event, only to be let down and short-circuited by the surprise ending.You will definitely enjoy this book, and be enlightened to learn more about life during the Depression, but keep it in perspective, let's not give standing ovations for every good show.",4,"It's good but let's get real, it's no great epic",1247702400,"07 16, 2009"

That seems to be a stretch.However, I did find this book a good representation of circus life during the hard years of the 1930's and 40's. The explicit sex and the animal cruelty were and are upsetting but fit the development of characters in the book. Interestingly, as I read it I recalled several admonitions from my family in the 1940s---avoid the ""carny"" workers, don't let go of my hand because you can't trust the circus slicks---they will take your last penny and you won't get in to see the circus if you hang around the hawkers, etc."" And I remember my brother being offered a free ticket to get into the circus if he would haul water for the animals. Needless to say, our parents didn't allow it. However, we all thrilled to the circus acts and loved the music and gaudy displays---so much so that when I had grandchildren I couldn't wait for them to be old enough to take in a circus experience. It wasn't in a tent, it was Madison Square Garden and it was still a thrilling experience.The most significant part of this book for me was the dual storyline involving Jacob the young man and Jacob the 90+ yr. old now living in a nursing home. The fact that Jacob wants to run away again to the circus is certainly understandable when you realize how lonely he is and how he can't find anyone to connect with in the home. Instead of being w/o money to fulfill his life dream of being a vet and in practice w/his father, he is now emotionally starved for a meaningful relationship. That part of the story is what needs to be taken to heart by readers and in some way used effectively in our contacts with the elderly.

Water for Elephants is the novel I will now be pressing on those people who say they only like reading history or biography rather than fiction.  Although readers will get lost in the invented world in this book, they will also learn a great deal of real facts about the Depression, train circuses and animal behavior along the way.  And they will feel the plight of Americans in the grip of economic panic in ways that most history books cannot convey.  Photographs at the beginning of most chapters both illustrate the plot and confirm that most of this unbelievable story really did happen.  I particularly loved learning about the mechanics of circuses, how they were set up, taken down, how the crowd was shaken for every last nickel, how they performers and animals were fed and housed.  The paperback edition contains an interview with the author and other notes that describe the research that went into the book and reveal that a few of the more amazing events in the novel actually occurred.

The alternating story between the daily life of a 90-ish year old man and his cantankerous behaviour with his youth as a circus vet kept my attention; the details about the social heirarchy between members of the circus was (on the authority of a former circus roustabout friend of mine) accurate; and I have to admit, I am a sucker for a love story.  However, as previous reviewers have noted, the 1930's vernacular, and the mannerisms of men of that era were abhorrent - but then I am a stickler for these kinds of detail.The story - of a Cornell vet student who quits his final exams before graduation to join the circus and his subsequent adventures (and love story) has undoubtedly caught the imagination of the vast majority of Amazon reviewers - including myself.  Yet I deduct a star because of the lack of attention to detail regarding the male protagonists and the verbage of the time.

A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,0002007770,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",1,1,"Almost every child has dreamed about running away to join the circus.  In the days of the big top, there were lots of menial jobs that kept those who wanted to be part of the circus busy from before dawn into late into the night, even if those jobs often involved nothing more glamorous than shoveling up the remains of an elephant's snack.Water for Elephants starts with an elderly (at least 90 years old) Jacob Jankowski remembering snatches of his past as he frets over the indignities of living in a nursing home while his children ignore him except for token rotating visits on Sundays.  One memory in particular stands out, a violent memory that he didn't share with anyone for over 70 years.Most of the book moves through flashback into the 1930s when America was broke and people were starving.  Into this challenging world, Jacob has high expectations as he finishes up his veterinary training at Cornell.  But the hand of God intervenes, and his life will never be the same.He soon finds himself serving in any role that he can get at BENZINI BROS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH (as the rail cars read).  This isn't the big time.  It's just surviving by staying one step ahead of the local sheriffs while not delivering on promised acts and providing entertainment for men that has nothing to do with being a circus.  This circus doesn't even have an elephant.Much of the story involves the nitty gritty of how circuses operated in those perilous times.  It's a story that encompasses lots of cruelty, deceit, and harshness.  In fact, it's enough to make you wonder why you ever dreamed about running away to join the circus.  So if you would like to keep that dream shiny, perhaps this wouldn't be the best book for you to read.At the center of the story are three people and one elephant.  Marlena is the queen of the circus, the star of the equestrian act that involves first 12 and later 10 horses.  She's married to the volatile August who runs the animal acts.  When Jacob becomes involved in caring for the animals, Jacob is invited to dine and party with the couple.  The relationship becomes more complicated when Jacob finds himself drawn to Marlena and repelled by August.  When the circus buys an abandoned elephant that seems unusually stupid, the equilibrium is destroyed.Ultimately, the book is about responsibility and loyalty . . . qualities that are more important in and taken more seriously by the circus world than by the ""rubes"" who attend the circus.  The message will serve as yet another indictment of our modern world which favors efficiency over doing the right thing.The book is beautifully illustrated with vintage photographs of early circuses that nicely match the story line of Water for Elephants.Unlike many authors of such historical fiction, Sara Gruen does a good job of keeping a few surprises up her sleeve.  So don't quit mid-book thinking you know how the story will turn out.Grab a shovel . . . and dig in!",5,A Surprising Look at Circus Life in the 1930s,1193788800,"10 31, 2007"

Well it's okay--but I'm convinced it's the ending that's leaves readers recommending it to friends. It has a typical Hollywood happy ending.The story prior to the ending is nice enough. It's pretty short and has a few interesting photos taken from the Ringling archives. I thought the details of the Great Depression were woven niceley into the story and it seemed well researched.That being said I don't think the story was as deep or detailed as it could have been. Gruen obviously had some rich material at her fingertips. I can't help but think she could have done more with it.I also found the constant interjection of Old Man Jacob Jankoski distracting and annoying. Although, the parts are well-written and moving--definitely makes me twice about the elderly--He seems completely unnecesarry to the plot of the novel and I thought his space in the book should have been filled with something else-preferably, the developing romance between Marlena and Jacob.Pluses: Cover, Research, subject manner, Walter ""Kinko"", The ending.

A2QPBFP0TF8PAI,0002007770,Donna (Girl Who Reads),1,1,"This review originally appeared on my blog.If you are considering trying audio books, I think this would be an excellent one to start with. I loved the narrators, they really added something extra to the story. Also this story is meant to be told orally and listening to it really makes it all come to life.I was a bit worried when I decided to listen to this book. I don't usually like books that involve animals, mostly because of the guaranteed heart fail. Not only does this book have animals, it is set in a circus. Having worked as a zookeeper, I learned some of the not so nice things that happen to circus animals. Then add to it, the story is set during the Depression. All of these had me cringing a bit. But who hasn't dreamed of running off to the circus?I was hooked in the first few minutes of the reading. I could tell that it would be a story I would lose myself in. I have to say though I was a little annoyed with the music playing in the background. Particularly with the older narrator as it made it difficult for me to hear him clearly.Oddly enough, it was the scenes of the older Jacob that had tears coming to my eyes, rather than the animals. It sucks to be old and his story is probably far more common than not. Though I did cringe every time August had a scene with Rosie. I was also a little shocked at the debauchery that took place at a circus (today it is such a family event).The descriptive nature of the story had me feeling like I was there at the circus. I could smell the popcorn. hear the cheer of the crowd, and when I closed my eyes I was in the menagerie with all the sights and sounds that come with a tent full of animals. More so than any other audio book I've listened to, there was a mini movies running through my mind.I went to see the movie a couple of days after finishing the book. I don't usually like to see the movie version so soon after finishing a book because the details of the book are so fresh in my mind. But I have to say, the movie was so well done that I fell even more in love with the story. The movie left out the parts that I found annoying in the book (in particular the back and forth between the old Jacob and young Jacob). I do have to say that I was a tiny bit upset that BoBo was cut from the film. I think he might have been my favorite animal.",5,Excellent audiobook,1309910400,"07 6, 2011"

He doesn't remember how old he is or even the people that take turns coming to visit him.  But what he does remember more than makes up for his current state of boredom.  The beginning reminded me of Stephen King's ""The Green Mile"".  The author obviously had to do a great deal of research into circus life during the depression in order to write this book.  What she found does not make a pleasant story.  Being an animal lover, the cruelty displayed toward the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, really disturbed me.  I still have a hard time believing that Jacob, who had nearly received his degree as a veterinarian and loved Rosie, would not have done more to prevent it. The cruelty displayed towards the employees was just as bad.  Railroad goons would actually push workers off moving trains in the middle of the night rather than pay them.  I thought the affair between Jacob and Marlena was not as torrid as it should have been.  Rosie was my favorite character - she was described in human terms which made the cruelty more difficult to endure.  In the end, both the peon workers and Rosie got even.  But that was not even the ending that made this book such a great read.  I was so excited when I read the ending, I had to tell someone about it!

A1RZU0AMACWSFQ,0002007770,"Doug ""dcb""",1,1,"When my two sons were perhaps 6 and 10, I took them to the circus here in Salt Lake City, Utah.  They were remarkably nonplussed:  ""Duh Dad, a bear riding a bicycle?""  And so, going back in time 75 years to get the look and feel of circuses was a lot of fun.  Dusty, stinky, hard work, low pay, railroads, animals escaping, fat ladies, dwarves, clowns, all of it.  But the heart of the book is the story of Jacob, a young veterinarian (who hasn't yet passed the exam), who is pulled out of his orderly life and into the circus world virtually overnight.  And suddenly, here he is, in a different world, a young and handsome 23 year old being used and abused by the men and women in this crazy circus sub-world.The story is told by Jacob at age 93 and now living in a rest-home.  Going between old Jacob with nurses clucking about trying to get him to behave, and then going back in time telling the circus story, reminds me of the old lady's perspective in the movie, ""The Titanic,""  who is telling the story of young Jack and her life altering romance with him.  There's something about the technique that makes it all seem very real, like it's all in the present.Jacob's romance with one of the young, beautiful circus performers is a touching and believable tale.  The hucksterisms of his two bosses who run the circus, are also very realistic and an important part of the story.  I won't give too much away here, in case you haven't yet read the book, but an elephant named Rosie is also one of the main characters of the book who makes sure things turn out as they're supposed to.A very fun, touching and unique piece of american historical fiction.",4,Come and Join the Circus,1192320000,"10 14, 2007"

The book balances the dynamics of maintaining a circus in tough economic times against a host of vivid and disparate personalities that can both support and challenge the stability of the circus. For example there is Big Al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality, ""redlighting"" individuals who violate his rules. There is August, second in command, alternately tough and gracious, supportive and cruel. There is Jacob, the hero, who stumbles into the world after fleeing Cornell Vet School and who subsequently falls in love with August's wife. The book alternates between the young Jacob in the circus and the elderly Jacob in a nursing home.

Young man falls in love with a woman out of his reach, thinks his love in unrequited but can't help to yearn for her and therefore continues to woe her. And just when he thought his chances are gone, she confesses that the feeling's mutual. Aha, what about the evil, schizo husband? Well, they go through heaven and hell to escape him and that's basically it. The love story.And so it's not a surprise that the characters are not of great depth. Jacob is the naive, testosterone-bursting young fella who knows what or who he wants but doesn't have a clue how to get it. And is showered with luck and good friends to support him. Marlena, is the charming damsel in distress and her husband the wicked yet brilliant villain.But all those flaws, as great as they seem, are overridden by Gruen's superbly paced and gripping storytelling of a magical world of a bygone era. The world of the travelling circus in the 1930s she described just sucks you in. The lack of depth of the human character is replaced by the depth of character of their animal counterparts. Rex and Leo, the lions, Bobo the chimp and Rosie the Elephant. The story just came alive with all those great period details.Also, despite of the predictable outcome of the love story, it is the structure of the narration that keeps you glued until the last page. Gruen zooms back and forth between Jacob's old self, a miserable 93 yo in a nursing home, wifeless and seen as a mere duty to his family and his young self. The way old Jacob yearns for life is all too familiar and is echoed in the young Jacob's lust for life. Ultimately, you want to know what happens to both Jacobs: Will the young Jacob win his love, and will the old Jacob regains his peace of mind?Finally, this is not high literature. Like a circus show, Water for Elephants is entertaining, exhillirating, memorable, beautiful and therefore makes a great holiday read.

I mean cmon!  It's a nearly 5 star book! Except that it never did.  Not even when it go the ""exciting"" part.One reviewer mentioned that it seemed as if the author realized they need to ""wrap it up"" and hustled the story along.  Where a day in the beginning took several pages, when it finally got to the ""good stuff""...it was all done in a few paragraphs or very few pages.  It was an ok read at best, but it's not a 5 star book.  A 5 star book should be a book that consumes you and stays with you when it's over.  This book simply didn't do that.  It told a story, wrapped up and ended.It almost seemed like the author didn't really connect or have real grasp on the characters when writing the ""past"" parts.  When she wrote about elderly Jacob, it was spot on and you really felt what Jacob was feeling and got immersed into his world.  While when reading about young Jacob, you feel more like you are just reading a story about someone.  For me the best books are those that put you in the world of the character, and for whatever reason, Sara could only do this in the present storyline.Also, the ending of the present day Jacob was a little lackluster I thought, and completely unrealistic.  It kind of took away from what good the book had.Bottom line:  it's an ok read, but I can't say that I'll be going around recommending it to my friends or anyone who asks about it.COMPLAINT:  Before I reviewed this Kindle Book...it was $5.00.  When I bought it, the price had gone up to $6.39.  I noticed that the cover changed to the ""movie one"".  This seems RIDICULOUS since Kindle readers don't really have a use for covers.  Also, the original book has old time pictures of circus people.  The Kindle version does NOT have this, because the movie book doesn't have them either (I checked in a local store). Which makes sense in that you can't have a movie cover with pictures that don't relate to the movie so they were evidently removed.  But I was not happy that I paid more for a book with less just because two actors now grace it's cover on an ebook.

Fate has intervened, however, and it turns out that the train belongs to a traveling circus, which ends up hiring him on as the show's animal doctor. The year is 1931, jobs are scarce, and, as Jacob quickly discovers, Uncle Al, the show's unforgiving ring master, and August rule the circus with an iron hand. Performers are treated well, but working men often go unpaid or worse, are ""red lighted,"" or thrown off the moving train in the dead of night. It is a brutal world, and Jacob walks its fine line between working men and performers. One day Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the show's star attraction and the wife of homicidally paranoid schizophrenic August, and their worlds at the circus will never be the same.This is an excellent and engrossing novel, told from the point of view of Jacob both in 1931 and today, with him at age 93 and in a nursing home, reflecting on past memories. Pull back the tent flap and step right in to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.

When I read in Entertainment Weekly the Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison would be starring in the film adaptation of Water for Elephants, I knew that I had to pick it up. I rarely pay full price for a book. However, this one had such rave reviews that I couldn't help myself. Still, it sat on my bookcase until this week when I promised to read it before the opening of the movie. Honestly, I was greatly disappointed.Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski who is so distraught after his parents' deaths that he runs away with the circus. He leaves between his education at Cornell University and his future as a veterinarian. Fortunately, his study of veterinary medicine helps him land a job as the circus' vet. While touring with the circus he meets a number of characters from a red haired midget clown, to an old circus worker who is struck with ""jake walk"" (a condition brought on by drinking tainted whiskey). Jacob soon discovers that life on the road is beyond trying. When an elephant is brought on as part of the show, Jacob finds himself torn between his job as a compassionate vet and the rules of the circus. This causes Jacob to bump heads with his boss, August, who is beyond temperamental and at times masochistic. To complicate matters, Jacob is in love with the lead actress of the show, Malena, who just happens to be August's wife.While the subject matter of the circus would seem to be incredibly interesting, this novel was boring from start to finish. The entire plot was cliched, the relationships were shallow, and the characters were without depth. From the first chapter, I knew the exact path that the novel was going to take. Every time I thought to put the book down, I convinced myself to give it one more chance. It was after all a bestseller, therefore, I thought it would get better. It never did. If anything, it got worse as every cliche was reinforced. The only twist came at the very end and was so absurd I had to re-read the last few pages three times over to make sure that I read it correctly. A book is only as good as its character development but in this novel there is no development. Though Jacob attempts to mature, he can't seem to figure out what his priorities are. Incidentally, neither can Gruen for she has Jacob bemoan his conflicting emotions between his love for Marlena and his feelings towards animal abuse. Fortunately for Jacob, the animals take their fate into their own hands which relieves Jacob of having to develop. I hope, for the box office's sake, that the movie fails to resemble the book.

The author does everything she can to exploit the reader's concern for cats, dogs, monkeys and, of course, the titular elephant. The narrator  is a vet who sticks with the circus, at first, in order to protect the animals, but he does little to interfere with their mistreatment... or the mistreatment of his fellow humans. In that sense, the book rings false. The book exploits the reader's feeling for animals and animal-human relationships for some cheap emotional effect. And it worked on me to some extent because I  cared about (and shed shed tears for) the animals much more than the humans. But I fail to see larger point.",3,"Nice Read for Some, Maybe Not for Animal Lovers",1217894400,"08 5, 2008"

Gruen cuts effortlessly between a faultless evocation of a seedy circus during the Depression - a grotesquerie if ever there was one -  and the modern-day life of an nonagenarian trapped in a failing body and a souless nursing home. Gruen's vivid prose and dead-on dialog transport the reader to a place and time, both physical and emotional, that does not fail to fascinate.  What in less talented hands might easily be a depressing tale of old age is animated by the spunk and wit of her main character.

""Jacob Joins the Circus"" is not in the thoughts of either Jacob but life is funny for a vet student who suffers a personal crisis, hits the rails and jumps onto the only train filled with patients for whom he's trained to assist and human subjects of a certain period.It's 1931 and the Great Depression is in full stench. With creatures of every variety in need of his services, Jacob becomes part of the Benzini Brothers, a circus dying to be Ringling Brothers and as we learn, their management, headed up by Uncle Al, a brute in anyone's managerie is ready to literally dump dead weight and steal what he needs to drive that train where he wants it to go. Jacob endears himself as a necessary component and survives the late night ""redlighting"" that makes roadkill of certain colleagues.Love springs eternal as both young and old Jacob encounter women who make the journey worth hanging for. When the elephant comes to town, the men of both eras are drawn closer still and we can feel their joy, their pain, their passion writ in every color of the literary rainbow. Ms. Gruen clearly has a passion for the subject and has researched every nuance and trick of the period(s) and the ride is a rollick. Certain characters pop in without much preamble and we feel genuine pain for little Walter and his doggie, and for Casey, the victim of ""the Jake,"" an ailment wished on no person. The deepest sympathy is felt for the largest of creatures, Rosie, and we wince at every poke of the trainer's prod, every command misunderstood and yet she's not why we bought a ticket to the show.Water for Elephants avoids the traps of a parable, or a fairy tale, or a moralistic thriller, and we're left with what we came for: a well paced story filled with great characters who remain there after the day ends and by the end of the ride, it's a Book for Everyone.",4,Zoom,1212019200,"05 29, 2008"

Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.

It was a book I actually kept my nose in for a good while. So that at least, warrants the three stars I gave it. I absolutely love the era that this book is set in, which is what provoked me to pick it up in the first place. The second thing that convinced me is I'm also in love with circus tales.Those aside, I liked the 'back and forth' of Jacob's presentation: going from his snarky elderly self to his younger memories, and the fact it was an easy read. I picked this book up expecting it to be easy. I like my 'hard' reads, too. I like complex stories that turn my gears, but I don't expect every book I pick up to be woven like a 1000 piece puzzle. This was not one I held such expectations to, so I won't fault it for not being 'challenging' in the least to follow.For the cons, like so many have expressed... the sexual scenes. Alright, I'm not some prude who turns her nose up to any spot of sex in a book, but I did not pick up this book expecting to read about a midget pleasuring himself that's for darn certain. I wasn't offended by the sexual content itself, it was more the SUDDEN nature it decided to appear within the plot. So sudden it often startled me into a state of being offended, and skipping ahead until it seemed the story was back on track again.I think all that time spent on the sexual spin could have been put into developing characters and...perhaps researching a bit more to the atmosphere the book is set in.",3,Unrealized Potential,1317859200,"10 6, 2011"

A2Q98M3724E710,0002007770,E.L,1,3,"I've heard much about this book and to hear that it was about the circus, I went in expecting it to be a great book.I am a little disappointed. Although the author no doubt put much research into this, I never got into the story. Maybe because I felt the book didn't have a really strong, solid plot to it and it just went on and on about Jacob's day working at the circus. The romance that was thrown in wasn't believable and therefore, failed to further the paper-thin plot.Any good story needs a strong cast of characters. 'Water for the Elephants' had many interesting characters that went in and out of the woodwork but none of them felt real to me. They were shallow and two-dimensioned and I didn't have much emotional connection to them. The one character that was arguably more developed was the dwarf and in the end, even Jacob didn't seem to care much about him. The main character Jacob wasn't engaging to me; he's faced with animal abuse and spousal abuse and he feels sorry, etc. etc, but he's not proactive about anything. His romance with Marlena was...contrived and random. Jacob showed no indication on WHY he loves her - readers are just told that 'She looks like Catherine' (a college crush) and they just fall madly in love with each other. The dialogue between them was just cringe-worthy and mostly consisted of Marlena bursting into tears. Not exactly strong enough to have the whole book revolve around their relationship, which I think is the downfall of this book.The writing style of this book was very straight-forward and easy to read. I was expecting some great, beautiful writing hearing all those positive reviews like in 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' but I guess not. The writing and the plot seemed amateurish and predictable. The ending was just too contrived and too neatly wrapped up.All in all, this was a quick read, not really thought-provoking or challenging. I was reading it while on breaks and it was easy to fall out and in of it - which isn't really a good thing.

That's something I'd never read about and DID find interesting, and it's probably what kept me reading all the way to the end.The characters however were not that well developed, especially Marlena. Most of the time she comes off as an airheaded child, a woman easily fooled and manipulated. It's also sort of difficult to really imagine Jacob and Marlena being so completely in love, as they don't really have anything in common other than their love of animals. Also not a big fan of the book flashing back and forth between 22 year old Jacob and 91 year old Jacob. Most of the ""old Jacob"" chapters are tedious to read and the payoff at the end with him is pretty small--especially as you aren't really sure how he got to be so grumpy and bitter.The main thing I disliked about this book is that it gives away the ending in the first chapter. You know the bad guy is going to die from page 1. So the rest of the book has you feeling pretty indifferent because you already know what the outcome will be.

I found Water for Elephants to be captivating, humorous, and heartbreaking.The book begins with a young veterinary student who discovers that his parents have been killed in a car accident. He returns home to find that he has been left with nothing and that his parents had put everything at stake for his ivy league education. When they died their home, veterinary practice, and savings were all lost to the bank. Overcome by grief, he is unable to complete his finals and runs away from everything and everyone he knows. At a loss for direction and purpose, he jumps a train in the dead of night hoping to find himself in a strange town where he can start to live again. Instead, he finds himself on a circus train, where he becomes engrossed in a community unlike anything that he has ever experienced.

I found that book in Water for Elephants.Through 331 pages I was drawn in from the beginning. The basic plot is it's about a man who joined the circus during the depression, and all the strange and amazing things that transpired. I was so completely drawn in by the story, that I didn't want to put it down. At the end of the book, the author says that most of the oddities told in her story were actually taken from real events at other circuses.I laughed, I cried, I told Nick that I would watch TV with him later.

We are there to witness the moment in this man's life when the smooth path he is on is up-heaved with the death of his parents and the loss of his future veterinary practice. His new course turns out to be on the tracks and with the belly of the circus.With the help of an old roustabout, Jacob learns the language and hierarchy of the circus, and eventually lands a job as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth's vet. We learn with our protagonist the dirty reality of day to day life of a traveling circus in 1931. A colorful host of secondary characters help Jacob on his journey, with the most important being Marlena, the show's star equestrian, and her husband, the cruel animal master, August.Jacob and Marlena's paths soon become twisted and intertwined as the fall in love, and try to find their escape from her insane, brutal husband and the circus that they are trapped in serving. Their answer comes in the form of an elephant named Rosie, and a fateful disaster that destroys those holding them back, while free the lovers to their happily ever after.This story comes full circle in the end as 93 year old Jacob finds himself once again at the gates of the big top, and is given a chance to go home once again.",5,Transported to the Circus,1295136000,"01 16, 2011"

As you may or may not know, I am a HUGE fan of Robert Pattinson. I definitely like him more than I should. Robert Pattinson aside, I am so glad I read this book. I did not know what to expect, but it was absolutely amazing!The main character, Jacob, is so easy to like. He has lived an extremely interesting life. In the beginning, he is a veterinarian student who is about to take his final test to become a full-fledged vet. Unfortunately for him, a tragedy claims his parents' lives, and he becomes too emotionally broken to even start the test. He ends up jumping on a train that happens to be a circus train, so he is practically thrown into this world as the circus vet.I really loved this book for so many reasons. One, Jacob is a vet (sort of), which I love because that is what I want to do. You can obviously tell he loves animals. The characters were complex and intriguing. The bad guys like August and Uncle Al had so many levels to them that they were often hard to read. Rosie, the elephant, was probably one of my favorite characters. Even if she is an elephant, she was so funny and smart! She definitely made the story so much better because I could not help but love her.Water for Elephants is an amazing book.

The dialogue sounded far too contemporary and the stage directions -- ""I looked out the window""; ""He moved his jaw before answering""; ""I looked steadily at her then looked away""; and the dramatic ""in the distance I heard the sound of a camel"" -- were intrusive. Add to that the constant  cutting back and forth from young-buck Jacob to retirment-home Jacob and you feel not that you're immersed in another world, but rather reading the script of a touching Hallmark Theater production.The characters are from central casting: the good hearted whore, the tyrannical boss, the crazy husband and his sweet but long-suffering wife. And the noble hero. Young and bereft of family, Jacob stumbles into circus life and is hired as a vet. He is painted as the champion of the small and weak, regardless of sex or species, always wanting to do good and right. And yet, at the moment when his friends need him most, he's gone, taking their only means of protection, a knife, with him. And the elephant for whom he professes deep affection he leaves to the hands of a crazed maniac, to be beaten not once but twice, and our hero does nothing about it. How can we possibly cheer for him?Too bad the story wasn't told from the POV of a minor character named Greg. Greg shows up twice, first when he retrieves the elephant using what he knows she loves, booze. He shows up later ministering to her wounds from one of the beatings. He's speaking Polish to her, the language she understands. Why did we need Jacob? Sounds like we already had a vet, and a worthy hero, standing in the wings.",1,Speechless,1200614400,"01 18, 2008"

Does anyone understand where exactly that came from? One minute he sees her across a crowded room and then bang!she just happens to love him too. Okay then, don't bother to really get to know each other. Some of the characters were hardly developed, Marlena mainly. There were moments I found to be quite crude and crass. However, somehow I know that years from now I will look back at this read fondly.My best guess is that I just liked the voice found throughout the novel. In fact I would go so far as to say the narration was superb. I have always been a fan of first person and while the bulk of this story is in fact first person, Gruen superbly weaves a sort of third person narration. The transitions are so smooth that you barely notice the shift. Gruen is just a superb narrator or maybe it's Jacob who does the great job?Now for a few thoughts on the film; I have four words, don't waste your time. If the narration and not the actual story is what makes the book then it is a no brainer that a movie would fall very short. This film was really not good, at least from where I was sitting.

AAKCPG62TYK2V,0002007770,"EOSmm ""EOSmm""",0,0,"I loved this book.  I could not put it down once I began reading it. Perhaps it's because I'm rapidly approaching the age where I could end up in a nursing home myself, but that part of the book fascinated me. It's from the perspective of a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It rang true.  I was touched by the nurse who treated him like a person, who explained things to him, and cried with him when his family failed to show up to take him to the larger-than-life event he had looked forward to throughout the book--the circus.  It made me think back over the experiences with our own parents and wish I could go back and do things differently.The other part of the book, the flashbacks into this man's history were fast-paced and exciting.  I immediately sympathized when, as a young man, he lost his parents and found himself alone in the world, and understood his running away from it all. Maybe I question the believability of one or two points while he traveled with the circus, but not enough that it marred my enjoyment of the book.  I simply took it as an indication of how much things have changed in this country over time. What would not fly now might have at one time. It opened my eyes to how easy it is to become absorbed into any society (even the world of a traveling circus)  and how to survive, a person must abide by rules they might otherwise never consider.  The book showed the higher and baser aspects of human nature, all of which I found easily believable.  The world is filled with people who have differing stories and problems.  We don't all behave the same or believe the same, but we do conform to the ethics of our individual worlds--good or bad.  I believe the author demonstrated that  beautifully.I read some of the other reviews, and was saddened that some people couldn't see past  the imperfections and simply enjoy the different facets of the story.

A2H3O3CGYKISQ2,0002007770,Equine Sports Med,503,620,"This book was recommended by Amazon as I was buying another, it looked interesting from the cover, so I bought it.  I actually was surprised to find that the main character was a vet from Cornell--since I am a vet from Cornell, it really spiked my interest.  That was the high point of the read, a brief moment of pleasant expectation.  The book is not awful or unreadable, it's just shallow and facile.  An interview with the author explains that she became fascinated by old photos of the traveling circuses of the 1930, and wanted to write a book about them.  The setting seems authentic and compelling.  However, the characters are implausible and their interior lives are culturally anachronistic.  No one in this book seems remotely believable for the period--hasn't she read any Steinbeck?  The plot is like one of those traveling carny roller-coasters, where you hear each gear clunk loudly and laboriously into place.  The movie is likely to be ten times better than the book, because you won't have time to consider how unlikely the story development is.I think it is rather shoddy that Ms Gruen limited her careful research to only the subject that interested her--the circus.  How hard would it have been to consult an equine vet and come up with a plausible scenario for the equine illness that brings the main character on board the train?  How hard would it have been to learn the correct location to euthanize a horse with a gun?  How hard would it have been to figure out that Ithaca was an end of the line station, and a through circus train would not be ""passing by"".  Couldn't she have gotten her character on the road without having him lose the family home to ""his Ivy League tuition""--even the most cursory research would have revealed that Cornell Vet College was and is a state institution, highly subsidized in every respect.  Authenticity in all these details would not have detracted from the book.Most of the criticism of the book I've seen on line has been focused on what is perceived by some as gritty detail and others as gratuitous cruelty to animals.  I am a horse vet, and have devoted my life to horses.  I have no problem with feeding horse meat to the big cats.  But the total implausibility of having the inept assistant slaughter horses by slitting their throats is so ridiculous--the first poke with his dull knife, and even a horse drooping at death's door will be three fields away.  The average adult horse has 50 liters of blood--can you imagine how long it takes to pour out 50 soda bottles?  This is why people euthanize horses with bullets!  Why oh why couldn't she make it believable--there was certainly no shortage of true cruelty to animals to chronicle?I can only imagine that people love, love, love this book because it is easy to read (clear, straightforward writing, not challenging in the least) and puts 21st century TV movie sensibility into an interesting historical setting with a sappy happy ending.",1,Lamer than a foundered horse...,1196208000,"11 28, 2007"

A28SBPF6KFZ7VL,0002007770,Eric K.,0,1,"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is like candy for readers.  It was one of two best books I've read in the past year.  In fact, it probably ranks as one of my favorite books of all time.  It was expertly, yet simply, written by Sara Gruen.  The novel tells the story from the perspective of Jacob Jankowski who currently resides in a nursing home.  The story alternates between Jacob's current living situation and the story of his past, how he once worked in a circus during the first part of the 20th century.  The impending visit of a traveling circus next door to the nursing home prompts him to remember the details of his circus life/experiences when he was a young man.Gruen's description of the nursing home, its residents, and its day-to-day activities was spot-on.  Having visited my grandparents on several occasions in their nursing home, I could easily visualize and relate to Jacob's experiences.  It really came to life.You can tell that a lot of research was also put into the circus recollections of Jacob Jankowski.  Gruen delves into circus life in the early 20th century when circuses traveled via train from town to town, and animal welfare and regulations were little more than an afterthought.  I found all of Jankowski's experiences intriguing and actually felt like I was experiencing them right along with him.  The characterizations felt realistic, too, and I could easily distinguish between the many different circus workers, and even some of the more prominent animals.It wasn't until halfway through the novel, though, that I realized how the nursing home is a metaphor for the circus.  Gruen makes subtle comparisons between the animals in the circus and the residents of nursing home.  They're both herded, fed, and prodded.  Jacob even says, ""I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person.""  So true.  And sad.Now that I've read this fantastic book, I'm very eager to see the forthcoming movie adaptation.  I'd like to say that I'd love to see a sequel to this great tale; however, I think Jacob Jankowski's story has already been told in full in this one well-crafted novel.",5,"Water for Elephants, Candy for Readers",1300665600,"03 21, 2011"

A1CHM200OEN65X,0002007770,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""",0,0,"You've heard the story about the blind man feeling an elephant and trying to describe what it is? In many ways, I felt the same way reading Sara Gruen's fast-paced and engaging story. It is an oddity. It is wondrous. And it also has some plodding, filthy elements.""Water for Elephants"" starts with a grippping prologue, during which we see the murder of a circus employee in the 1930s. The story then switches back and forth between young and old Jacob, a man who gets pulled into the circus life, discovers love, adventure, and trouble, and then reflects back on that as an old man. Gruen does a fine job creating this empathetic character, though the old man's story becomes less important and almost campy by the end. The young man's story delves deeply into circus life, with lots of interesting details and conflict, although the characters are all fairly black and white, with the villains being obvious and predictable. For some reason, Gruen also seems compelled to give us lurid details of the circus striptease and Jacob's own loss of virginity at the hands of the ""cooch tent"" prostitutes. Why these elements are described in such detail only detracts from the already shallow love story to come. It would be nice to see some intellectual dialogue between our male and female leads, rather than coy glances, ""shapely calves,"" and the surface attraction of teenage relationships.Soon, Jacob's background in veterinary studies allows him to find a place onboard the circus train, during which he falls in love with Marlena, a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. When the circus procures a new elephant for its act, it provides a link between Jacob and Marlena, as well as with Rosie the elephant. The problem is the jealous and psychotic August, Marlena's husband. We know he must be removed from the picture for this to work. Deeply ethical and moral issues come into play, but Gruen chooses the easy route and solves the problem in a somewhat satisfactory but highly implausible way. This is only underlined by the equally implausible solution of old-man Jacob's frustrations. Sure, it's all warm and gushy, but the deep research and texture of the circus and some of its elements give way to romanticized solutions that turn a historic novel into one of borderline fantasy.With all the fanfare over this novel and tie-in movie, I suspect I'll be accused of being the blind man here in my description of the ""elephant."" Many elements were strong and well done, but much like Sebold's ""The Lovely Bones,"" all of the wonderful storybuilding gives way to a conclusion that feels a bit forced and too easy.",3,"A ""Blind Man's"" View",1305676800,"05 18, 2011"

That being said... There was an abrupt ending of storylines and at one point she tied things together in a nice little bow. The book was a little inconsistent in the way it was written but overall an enjoyable read. I liked the ending alot. I won't spoil it but it seemed very natural of Jacob's character.

Huber,6,10,"Full disclosure:  I read 'East of Eden' just prior to this book and after luxuriating in Steinbeck's prose for the last few weeks, the comparison seems almost unfair.  'Water for Elephants' has a novel premise but the execution left me cold.  Gruen's prose is expository and workmanlike, and lacks the artistry of the great authors.  Obviously she's found her audience - and I did enjoy the story so I can't complain too loudly - but with so many truly great, well-crafted pieces of fiction out there, why waste your time?  Life is short.  Try some other contemporary authors instead, like Jonathan Safran Foer, Khaled Hosseini or Nicole Krauss...  or Steinbeck, for that matter ;-)",2,"Decent premise, uninspired prose",1190419200,"09 22, 2007"
A3VXSLUJ927PWW,0002007770,Erik Namls,1,2,"This is one of a handful of books I haven't been able to put down easily. Finished in two sittings(!), it's the tale of an old man, reflecting on his youth as a Cornell veterinary school dropout who joins the circus after learning he has no home or family to go back to. Carefully researched, Sarah Gruen takes the reader through a traveling circus from the depression era. Many of the subplots were taken from actual recorded events, adding to the realism of the book. The characters also represented each aspect of the circus; I became concerned for the stage dwarf as much as an old tent setter. The novel also switches from the past time in the circus to the present, where the protagonist reflects on his current state in the nursing home in an often comical fashion, giving a break to the main plot line and building suspense.

A18JHQF1G1TENN,0002007770,Erin Griffin,3,3,"I just finished reading Water for Elephants, a novel about a young man who travels with a circus in the 1930s. I read the book in just a few days, about half of which was in one sitting on a very lazy Sunday afternoon. It's a story full of forbidden love, painful regret, and dark secrets. Although the premise sounds a bit heavy, it was an easy read that kept my attention and kept my fingers turning the pages.Jacob Jankowski is a promising young man on the verge of graduating from Cornell University with a degree in veterinary medicine. A few days prior to completing his final exams, Jacob is faced with a difficult tragedy that keeps him from graduating. Suddenly finding himself on the street with no one to turn to, Jacob jumps onto a passing train in the middle of the night. By morning, he is the newest member of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob meets and falls in love with Marlena, a performer who happens to be married to August, the ""Equestrian Director and Superintendent of Animals"". August is also Jacob's boss. After a few weeks on the road, the show picks up an elephant named Rosie, which seemingly causes the show nothing but trouble. She steals lemonade, eats vegetables out of townspeople's gardens, and most importantly, does not respond well to direction. Jacob forms a bond with the elephant, but has to stand by and watch as August mercilessly punishes her for not obeying his commands.The next three months change the course of Jacob's life as he deals with an illicit love, circus politics between working men and performers, and witnessing a gruesome murder that he doesn't talk about for the next 70 years of his life. At 93 years old (or 90 - he can't remember exactly how old he is), Jacob decides it's finally time to tell his story.Usually, when I enjoy a book, I tend to be unhappy with the ending because it often seems to be such a letdown. However, I thought the ending of this book was very fitting for the story, and I was content as I shut the book and put it back on the bookshelf.",5,"Good read, interesting subject, kept my attention",1210896000,"05 16, 2008"

I am especially taken with the depiction of life in a nursing home with the body of a 93-year-old and the wit and mind of a much much younger man. It gave me a whole new perspective on how sad and depressing life must be like in an institution like that and will make me spend more time getting to know those who find their homes in such a place. But what struck me most was when I read the Afterward in which Ms. Gruen explained the motivation for writing this novel and the incredibly detailed research that she found herself doing just to put pen to paper. Not only is she so very gifted with the ease of writing, but she is very committed to the realism of details. Incredible! She took some really fascinating true stories from some of this country's most storied circuses and rolled them all into one incredible journey.

It was a sad place filled with lonely people staring out of the front doors just hoping family or friends would come visit them. Yet as you roamed the halls you could hear the most amazing stories of lives lived so fully when age did not seem to have the slightest grip.

This rule becomes a problem when a writer makes the verb more active than it needs to be. When that happens, the prose gets breathless, and it actually ceases describing what is going on in the scene.In this book, people don't sit up; thy JERK upright onto their elbows. They don't turn their heads; they TWIST their heads. They don't walk by; they BREEZE by. A train doesn't round the bend; it EXPLODES around the bend. The overly active verbs make even the most mundane event feel exaggerated like a comic book scene.And one would think that having such active verbs would make adverbs unnecessary, because the verb would be doing all the work. Not so. For instance, in the span of less than one page, she uses coquettishly, coyly, demurely, gently, lasciviously, firmly, utterly, suddenly and violently (45-46).If readers are interested in a story to take them away to another time and place, this book might fit the bill.

A73DFWJE0CGY6,0002007770,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""",2,3,"It is the present day. An old man, either 90 or 93 - he can't recall - lives in a desultory, grumpy funk in a generic nursing home, treated like a product, given impersonal but efficient care, and regularly visited by a vaguely attentive, dutifully loving, but clueless family. He is lonely; he misses his wife; he longs for attention from his prolific family, but understands that they have problems of their own. For solace, he relives his early life on a continuous thread - his life as a circus veterinarian for a second-rate travelling show.In alternating chapters, the author, Sara Gruen, takes us from the present to 1931 and back, showing us a rich history of a good young man whose life is changed forever when his parents die in a car crash, leaving him destitute just as he is to stand for his final exams at Cornell. He had hoped to go into practice with his father as a small-town vet; instead, at a total loss, he bolts, jumping a train which turns out to belong to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth (or words to that effect). He is plunged into the colourful, quirky world of the circus, with all its different intensities and personalities; at risk of being summarily thrown off the train, he is reprieved by Uncle Al, the owner/operator/ringleader of the circus when that gentleman learns that Jacob is - for all intents and purposes - a vet, something Uncle Al has coveted for a long time.Jacob falls easily into the life, loving working with the animals, learning to become one of the circus family, and finding an unlikely friend in the dwarf whose living space he shares. Along the way, and almost immediately, he also falls hopelessly in love with the wife of Uncle Al's right-hand man August. Marlena is the woman of the horses, directing her own act with 12 beautiful Arabians in the ring, and her grace and beauty completely captures Jacob. He must tread carefully; her husband, August, is borderline insane and insanely jealous.The old Jacob buries himself in these memories, frets over the static life of the nursing home, and learns to look for one particular nurse who seems to be the only person who really takes an interest in him. She counsels him gently; she brings him food that is just a little better than what he's been getting; and we get a glimpse, through his eyes, of the frustration of the elderly, trapped inside a body that won't cooperate anymore and surrounded by people who aren't interested in his bright former life.This was an absorbing, entertaining book, a complete joy. Well-written, well-researched, it opens a door on a world that most people never thought about and makes the different subjects into real people. It also made me feel empathy toward those in impersonal facilities, who live for a familiar, interested face, and who long to impart to us the lives they led. I could not put this book down.

A3IKBHODOTYYHM,0002007770,"fra7299 ""fra7299""",3,4,"Sarah Gruen clearly establishes and proves her research of traveling circuses in the 1920s and 30s in this novel. Written from the point of view of the protagonist, Jacob Jankowski, we find out how he is thrust into the world of circuses after he experiences a life-changing tragedy in his family, the death of his parents in an accident. The book goes back and forth from the present, with Jacob being in an assisted-living home, to the past, where Jacob boards a train and then, after being almost booted off, begins his world of traveling circuses aboard the Benzini Bros. With nowhere to go, and nothing to do, he begins the circus life, meets several of the key characters, such as Walter, Camel, Marlena, August and ""Uncle Al."" While Gruen's ability as a storyteller is there, I felt like the book was a letdown because of the direction it took with the main character.One substantial element to Jacob's personality is his connection and compassion for animals, but I felt like there were times when he isn't the strong leading character he could be, and that this compassion for animals is inconsistent. For instance, there is a point after becoming the Benzini Bros. personal veterinarian, he indicates that his protection for animals is unbending saying ""...and what my father would do--what my father would want me to do--is look after them, and I am filled with that absolute and unwavering conviction."" Yet, there is at least one instance when Jacob has a chance to stop the villain August from abusing Rosie, the elephant, but fails to take any action, despite how ruthless he knows August to be. Odd, considering that he makes some rash decisions, but none that are of much consequence.It also seemed odd to not focus more on the circus itself, as it pertained to Jacob and many of the other characters. Why not focus more on the spectacle of the circus, the performers, the competition between the rival circuses, and the pageantry of the event?  The potential to do this seemed to be there, especially the way the 93 year old Jacob reflects on the sweet memories of being in the circus, telling many workers in the hospital about those wonderful days with teary-eyed conviction.  Instead Gruen uses much of the book's energy on the ""forced"" relationship and wooden love affair between Jacob and leading circus performer Marlena, August's wife. I mean, if you are going to write about the circus, and do the research on it, why not concentrate more attention on events that involve the history of the circus. There was a pronounced shift to the love affair between Jacob and Marlena, especially in the novel's second half, and much of the dialogue between the two seemed hokey and silly. It made the book come across as a romance disguised as a circus story.Still, it was an enjoyable and relatively quick read. Gruen's ability to detail scenery and hook the reader into a story is present from the beginning to end and her writing flows smoothly. This is the kind of book that has many redeeming qualities, and makes for a good topic of discussion.I just wish the book wouldn't have ""sold out"" on a silly love affair; the potential for much more was there.3 1/2 stars",3,"Engaging writing, but too much focus on love affair",1198368000,"12 23, 2007"

Gruen shows the seedy side of the big top, the desperate times of the depression, the multilayered personalities of performers, roustabouts, owners, and even the animals, and balances it all delicately with the memories of an old man in an assisted living facility.I loved the way the title tied in to the story.

I too am shocked at the number of 5-star reviews, the ""guaranteed-you-won't-be-disappointed"", ""fantastic-read""-type hype.  It was light, entertatining fluff, yes, but certainly NOT for everybody, NOT great literature, and certainly had no deep, enduring themes that stay with you and haunt you for weeks (as 'Kite Runner' did for me).First of all, the comments about the intriguing setting and novel characters were correct.  It was an intriguing setting, with novel characters.  There.  Now onto the problems.The whole storyline felt distinctly soap-opera-ish, due in part to the dialogue and the shallow writing.  The characters had no depth whatsoever, very similarly written to Dan Brown or John Grisham's endless recycled characters.  Looking back on those books (I'll bet you've read more than one from each author, haven't you?  Come on, admit it), do you remember the characters themselves as distinctive?  No -- they were two-dimensional cutouts caught up in dramatic plots.  This is the exact same thing.  E.g. excerpt: ""She presses her face to my chest. 'Oh, Jacob--what are we going to do?' ""Which brings me to my next criticism: the dialogue comes across as very contrived and Grisham-ish.  Lots of people saying the listener's name.  LOTS of it.  Small nitpick, but it's one of those things that just doesn't ring true.Example:  ""Come on, Jacob"" says Earl, taking hold of my upper arm. ""The boss wants you to move along"".""Give me just a second, Earl,"" I say.My other criticism, which I haven't seen mentioned here, was the distinctly modern and  politically correct sensibilities of the protagonist(s) which came through somewhat anachronistically.  E.g., protagonist Jacob is dramatically indignant at the husband who beat his wife.  It was just too cartoon-characterish to me, too black and white.  Good guy, who has the delicate sensibility to be incensed at the injustices he sees around him; and the bad guys: wife beater and profit-monger.This could EASILY be adapted to a Disney movie.

It had such spectacle, and what a star-studded cast headed by the great Jimmy Stewart, Cornel Wilde, Betty Hutton...it was, just, well, awful.  Yes, AWFUL.  And ya know, Hollywood decided to give this giant piece of piffle the year's BEST PICTURE Oscar.

Could it be....to make the film more profitable???  Could it be....money, money, and hopefully more money????  To gush and fawn over something so abysmal, luring the public into conforming to the propogandic publicity, that it finally becomes a pseudo-masterpiece, not to be missed?Know what I mean?Because if you don't, then borrow (DON""T BUY!!), Sara Gruen's Best-selling monkey-poop called ""Water For Elephants"".

Make sure the story is narrated too, but make sure it's just about as pretentious a narration as you can dream up.  Then populate the text with various freaky deaky characters and situations....like animal torture and alcoholism.

I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals. Taking care of the animals makes him happy, and that is how he met Marlena. Beautiful, fragile, but married.I really liked this book. I loved how the author described life at the circus. It's obvious she investigated about circus, the people who worked at them, how they function, and their animals.But what I liked more was the writing. The story is told by old Jacob. He's 90 years old, or 93, and his memories about the circus, his wife and his life don't die. He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning.

She has more than studied it she has affectingly captured it in Rosie, a large gray elephant and the one hope of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a down at the heels circus trying to make a go of it during the Depression.Now, Rosie wasn't too much of a hope because she was lovable but could not follow any command .  Rosie's only unique characteristic was a seemingly unquenchable thirst for  lemonade.  Her inability to perform was no excuse for the intolerable cruelty visited upon her by August, the callous menagerie director who thought nothing of tossing a lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth.  He didn't limit his abuse to helpless animals but also mistreated his lovely wife, Marlena.Spellbindingly read by David LeDoux and John Rutledge Jones, Water For Elephants is at its heart the story of three - Jacob, who has lost his parents in a tragic accident, and finds a home with the circus, Marlena and, of course, Rosie.  It's a poignant look at their lives set against an oppressive, sometimes degrading circus world, and a look back at our country during the grueling Depression years.

Characters who have known each other for a very short time share passion and requited love for one another, vowing to be together forever when one of whom is still married.Some details like the villain being Jewish are completely impertinent to the story but makes you why exactly the author did that. The protagonist is lovable and portrayed in very positive light throughout the novel, but his actions are just as villainous and psychotic. At one point where the protagonist gets really jealous he climbs on the roof of a moving train while carrying a knife in his mouth, intending to kill the villain in a very really Indiana Joneseque segment that makes you giggle at how superficial the author's line of thought was.Without revealing too much, it's very close to Moulin Rouge, only without the interest, tempestuous music and theatricality.

With the recent release of the movie, I decided to pull my copy on loan from my bookshelf and read it before venturing out to the theater to see the movie (or, more likely now, renting it).Water for Elephants is definitely different from the other fiction I normally read.  The book takes place after the Great Depression, and Gruen did a lot of research surrounding circuses during that time to influence her book.  Many of the chapters began with a picture from circus archives, which really added to the experience of reading the book.  I absolutely loved how the chapters alternated between the main character's experience in his early 20's as the circus veterinarian and as a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It really made me think about the stories of my own grandparents, who are nearing their 90's themselves.The diverse cast of characters in the circus also made the drama of circus life a fascinating read.  I had no idea of the caste system in circus life, the treatment of employees and animals alike, and how competitive circus troupes were during this challenging era in U.S. history.I have heard that the book is better than the movie.  I admit that I am a bit skeptical about the movie given some of the casting choices for its main characters.

What you will get, is a bit of entertainment and slight escapism.  I'm a little baffled by all the hype.  I guess there really is marketing genius in this field and a savvy publisher can pry $23 right out of your hand if you're not careful.First the bad: The protagonist is Jacob, a Cornell educated veterinarian who has kept a secret since his young days when he joined a traveling circus (owned by a swindler, reminds me of certain publisher marketing techniques) and gets caught up in a dangerous love triangle. Most of the chapters take place in the circus' past, but occasionally the book transitions forward in time to modern day Jacob, who is 90 or 93, and living in an assisted living facility.  The modern day Jacob moans and gripes through the mundane events of the day at the nursing home.  That, along with prose that any student of English could write, left me feeling battered and ripped-off.  Gruen tries to cover it up by adding sensational debauchery to the story, but it doesn't work.Now the good: Kudos to the author for doing a good amount of research on depression era traveling circuses.  Some true tales of circus life that Gruen found while researching, are in the book. She read of an elephant that only understood German - in Gruen's novel, Rosie is thought to be stupid, until the main character, Jacob, realizes she was trained in Polish.  There is a hippo pickled in formaldehyde, and water from livestock troughs that gets filtered through the clowns' hosiery so it can be used to make lemonade for the circus patrons.  The result of the research is the key entertainment factor in this story.Gruen manages to merge the two stories into an unexpected and happy ending. I did enjoy, and find intriguing the 15 vintage, black-and-white photos of old-timey circus animals and performers. I urge you to approach with caution, if you do read this book however, please then; leave your two cents in a review.  I'm curious if it's just me who is feeling duped?  Maybe this is a great book and I just can't see it.

AK7D1BHZOSOL1,0002007770,General Pete,1,2,He's 90 or 93 he doesn't really remember and it doesn't really matter anyway because according to Jacob's nothing really matters after a few years in an old folks home.  His bitter and sarcastic exterior conceals a deep pain and the certain knowledge that the better years of his life have passed by.  As Citizen Kane says old age is the only disease that no one wants to be cured of.Things weren't always this way Jacob was young once until an unfortunate series of circumstances ended his hopes of being a vet forever.  He is then taken on a journey across the country with a circus it is a fun little book and well worse the trip.  The characters have life and everything that fictional characters should have.  You'll find it to be so good that even though you can see the ending coming from three miles away you will not even care.Overall-It is rare that I run across a book this good,5,Getting old is not for the faint of heart,1184112000,"07 11, 2007"
A2JY931RTV9EFB,0002007770,Geneva D Lewis,2,3,"I don't think the actual plot of this story interested me as much as the incredible setting and description of circus life in the early 1900's. I LOVE the historic photographs at the end of each chapter because it allowed me to see for myself the life-style that the story was trying to re-create. I wasn't all that attached to any of the human characters, but I loved the animals and actually think my favourite character was the Circus itself. I was able to view the Circus as a living, breathing character of it's own, and that is honestly where most of my intrigue for the story came from. I was not prepared for the amount of sexuality and language in the story! It was completely distracting from the story and I was disappointed how often it would randomly be thrown into the writing. I felt it was almost always unnecessary...it did more to detract from the novel than it ever could have added. I suppose it was a wake-up call for me about the difference between young adult fiction and adult fiction.

Scariest part about it is that I know it's based on the truth - not the story, but the time. She did great research on travelling circuses.The romance was gorgeous. And while I refuse to give out spoilers, I will tell you that she surprised me. I was sure the romantic outcome was going to come out one way and she made the change beautifully.The ending?

Yet, reading this book through Jacob Jankowsi's memories, I feel like I know what goes on like I've been many times before.""I don't talk much about those days. Never did. I don't know why - I worked on circuses for nearly seven years, and if that isn't a fodder for conversation, I don't know what is.""There is so much that happens in Water for Elephants, from the point where Jacob discovers his parents are dead and flunks his veterinary exam to the point he runs away to the circus (and unknowingly at that). Soon he discovers that the circus has so much to offer, and it's own perils as well. When he meets Marlena and begins developing feelings for her, he finds himself standing on thin ice with her husband August, and when things begin to turn sour it seems he's not the only one out to get him.""I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.""But there's another side to this story - the Mr. Jankowski who lives in the nursing home after the rest of his family seems to have forgotten about him. The man who doesn't quite remember how old he is. Who doesn't like the 'food' (if you can call it that). The man who still remembers his days at The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.The story was well crafted and encompassed all the different elements of life in the circus. Some actual photographs found at the beginning of each chapter added to the 'realness' of the plot and make the whole store seem even more realistic. Similarly, the characters were well developed, and the patriarchal hierarchy of circus performers vs. workmen was explored also. I loved to see how Marlena became a stronger character throughout the novel, eventually taking a definite stand against her mentally instable husband. And Jacob? Well, during the whole story he was there to learn the ropes and was always there to stand for what was right - for the animals he treated and the people he became friends with.*CONCLUSION*Overall, I really enjoyed Water for Elephants. I felt completely immersed in the circus lifestyle and was always desperately wanting to flick through the pages and find out what was happening next.

He jumps aboard a moving train-the train carrying the Benzini circus to its next production. No one on the circus cares that Jacob didn't finish his final exams. The diploma, he is told, ""is just a piece of paper, and nobody here gives a damn about that. You're on a show now. The rules are different.""In fact, the circus seems to have no rules at all. Jacob somehow finds other kind souls among the misfits, and these people work together to protect themselves and the animals.

The hero, Jacob, stuck in a nursing home at age 93 heroically laments every passing day, every last white hair, every forgetfull moment. Most of all he regrets that five children, more grandchildren, their spouses and other more remote relatives deem him utterly irrelevant.But the circus comes to town, sets up right next door, and takes Jacob (and us) back to his youth at the Great Depression's bottom.Through blind luck and interrupted training at Cornell's vet school, Jacob hooks up with a traveling circus and into the adventures of his life.Jacob's present predicacment and circus life of seventy years ago are told side by side seamlessly, each raising the intensity and charm and tragedies of the other time and other life. The details are true, the action as real as it getsAll together a delightful read, despite one sometimes nagging problem: Water for Elephants is written by a youngish woman who once or twice too often writes in the voice, diction, jargon, observations of youngish women--not of a very manly man, Jacob. As a male reader, closer in age to Jacob than the author, and also facing the hour glass of time considerably fuller at the bottom, I caught myself a few times thinking, ""That's not Jacob. He would not say that, think that, do that quite that way, though a Josephine might have.""

These two kept letting the sicko torture poor Rosie - I was disgusted how repetitive this scene became.Too bad the main characters couldn't have been Earl, who had to deal with these three - Greg, who should have been the veterinarian, and Walter, who was the only one with sense enough to recognize an evil sadist.

His story goes back and forth between his modern day stay at a nursing home and his days in his early 20s during the Great Depression traveling around the country with the Great Benzini Brothers Circus.Sara Gruen does a phenomenal job of painting a vivid portrait of Depression era America and of the end of the golden age of circus life in the USA.  The Photos that head each chapter are fun little bonuses that let you see the actual performers of this time as well as some of the settings in which the book takes place.The characters come to life and are vivid portrayals of heroes and villians.

But I picked this one up on the recommendation of a sibling's book club and devoured it on a long plane flight. I would never expect to be so engrossed in a theme of misfit (sometimes repulsive) circus rowdies and second-hand animal acts, but Gruen's writing style compelled me right into the narrative and once there, I had to keep reading to solve the mystery of what happened with the characters and why I cared! My only complaint with the way the story is resolved is that Gruen tried to do too much with biblical metaphors and clever double entendres.

Generally, I'm a little weary of modern fiction because well... in my head, at least, it doesn't really have the reputation for being the best or being incredibly full of depth - and Water for Elephants isn't really an exception in either of these areas. What I've always neglected was, even if a book is fairly shallow compared to so-called great literature, it doesn't mean it's totally without worth.Water for Elephants was an easy and enjoyable read, which is what I imagine a lot of people are looking for - especially those of us with demanding careers that just need to relax on occasion. My primary criticism of the book is that, occasionally, it bordered on very, very softcore pornography - don't get my wrong here, I'm no prude, but I feel a little awkward reading about dwarf penises on the subway... I'd like to keep my semi-erotic material a private matter. This complaint aside, the story really sucked me in and you can tell the author did her research.Worth one read? Probably.

From the freaks to the Menagerie of Animals and the elephant named Rosie, you will feel like you have arrived in the depression era in the circus, as you read along with Jacob and see through his eyes.

So much so that you forget your reading and start feeling like you are right there, right then.Love, Tragedy, Murder, Suspense,....You name it, this novel has got it!!!This novel will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it might even make you mad, but no matter what- you must read this novel.This novel is a great read suited for both men and women, so be sure to check this one out~I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!I enjoyed my time at the circus, I hope you do too!",5,Escape to the Circus,1155427200,"08 13, 2006"

There are times when I just want an escapist read. But given the perimeters--those reads usually deliver the goods. Though the stories may be a tad simple.Here we have a book that's been out a while. Supposedly one with some substance. So we have a guy who winds up joining the circus after ditching an Ivy league education in the Depression years.  I can go with it. No problem there. But then we have the host of characters in the circus itself. Some of this is good reading--but then--we have problems of cliched, predicatable writing wedged between sections of rather better-than-average writing. And all too many flat characters with little substance.Much of this appears in this story. That's the problem. Besides, Jacob is just not all that engaging to me or a convincing character. And the story comes off predictable and rather weak. So it's a passable beach read.Given the kind of over-the-top and unsubstantiated praise this novel has received, surely, I can't be the only one who feels this way and I can't help but notice than whenever there is a unfavorable review of this book  there will be an outpouring of five star reviews--one after another--that are all two or three sentences of praise and little real commentary.Coincidence?Again, not an altogether bad read, but this is no KITE RUNNER or actually, SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN, two far better reads than this.",3,Much ado about a so-so read,1178841600,"05 11, 2007"

Foster ""operabruin""",1,1,"I come here to write this review, of course, ""very late""....and so, perhaps many will not read what I have to say about this book.Being an avid reader, with interests all over the ""map"" so to speak, I have read God-Knows-How-Many stories in my 62+ years. Some deeply moving, others barely creating or leaving the slightest ripple in my conscious brain. Some, seemingly, with the power to change the way I see things or think about things...sometimes subtly, and in others there are major thought differences after finishing the book. This book has affected me deeply.The last book to touch me this way was some months back when I read ""The Piano Shop on the Left Bank"" by Thad CarhartThe Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelierwhich I heartily recommend to you.With ""Water for Elephants"" Sara Gruen creates the long-forgotten days of the Train Circus, and all that life entailed in those days...from the impossible ""set-ups"", ""knock-downs"", and in many cases ""hasty retreats"" from any particular chosen town before the authorities arrived upon the scene.""Hard Luck Days"" certainly would be a fitting genre to place this awesome story into. And, of course, with the depression, etc., they truly were hard luck days, for everyone involved with the exception of perhaps Uncle Al with his penchant for stealing, skimming, using and abusing everyone on the show. We also come to know August and his sickness that continually creates misery and unhappiness both for him, and also for those closest to him. There is Marlena, August's wife and performing partner with her performing horses, and later her act with Rosie the Elephant (a charming, and all-knowing wonderful beast if ever there was one). There are dozens and dozens of other characters, distributed throughout all levels of the show, from performers right on down to the dung-shovelers and the guys who do nothing but put up and take down the tents for the big top, day in and day out endlessly, working like dogs for sometimes nothing. We meet the midget clown Kinko also known as Walter and are shown into his rather twisted life, and also we meet Camel, an unfortunate, for sure, addicted to and dying from Jamaican ginger paralysis, a common and cruel death from drinking bad alcohol. We meet and deal with the sadistic Blackie, and witness his ways with dealing with those ""done with"" on the traveling show.Sara Gruen has created a most wonderfully ""real"" environment and ""time"" for this story to inhabit, one that clearly allows one to ""see"", ""feel"", ""smell"" and ""witness"" at what seems ""first hand"" how life was for those who lived ""the Big Top life""....a marvelous talent for a writer. If she were never to write another story, this one, surely, would guarantee her a place in the literary hall of fame....a beautiful, touching, funny, serious, deeply moving look at circus life in the 30's, and also a peek today into Jacob Jankowski's life as it is, and luckily, also, what it is about to become again.Truly, this is one of the Finest books that I have had the pleasure to read....a Perfect 10!Incidentally, Sara Gruen's new book is coming out within a couple weeks, titled ""Ape House"". Luckily I received an advance copy from the Vine Program to read and review, and I will be starting it just as soon as I finish here with this review of ""Water for Elephants"".Sara Gruen....You may never read this, but I wish to Thank You, personally, for giving us this truly Lovely, Wonderfully Entertaining book.

Do yourselves a favor, like me, and take this excellent journey with this gifted author.  Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a very moving story about relationships and family.  When Jacob Jankowski loses his family, he actually joins the circus.  Not because he wanted to, but because it presented itself.  Fortuantely, Jacob was studying to become a veterinarian and the circus was full of animals.  The story is told from the perspective of Jacob as an elderly man and Jacob as a young man.The relationships that Jacob forms during this excellent novel form the corserstone of the story.  I found myself caring about a grouchy dwarf and his 3-legged dog, as well as an elephant, and a cast of numerous colorful characters.  The evocative descriptions of the circus itself - the Benzini Brothers; a wannabee Ringling Brothers - during the Depression; actually put you on a railcar with the smell of dust all around you.  This is certainly no glamorous lifestyle, and Gruen does an exceptional job of providing vivid imagery.  The menagerie that Jacob helps care for are an important piece of this wide ranging cast that features individuals that are easy to hate and aome that are easy to love.  Jacob meets Marlena, who is married to the evil August, and the relationships that ensue become increasingly complicated.I now know more about circuses that I ever knew I wanted to.  I am glad that I do, because the learning was all part of the great fun to be had here.  This is a very entertaining and compelling book.  I could not read it fast enough, yet I felt myself wanting to slow down to enjoy it all the more.  I rate this a highly recommended 5 stars.

A20FK68BUB1IVA,0002007770,Happy Reader,1,1,"I read a lot of nonfiction and most of the fiction I read is mysteries, instead of ""literature"" novels. So when ""Water For Elephants"" was loaned to me with a recommendation, I put off reading it. The movie, which I didn't see, got underwhelming reviews, which made me postpone it further. I think I read two new mysteries before finally picking up this book.And then was I surprised.  I loved it! It is imaginative and takes me into the wonderfully described world of a 1930's third-rate train (traveling) circus. If this world seems a little grungy, I remind myself that at the beginning of the 1930's, only 10% of rural homes had electricity for hot water heaters.  Animal rights?  Nonexistent. Workers' rights? Taking its first baby steps.  Occupational safety - don't make me laugh.  Bigotry?  How can fiction be worse than the truth. And over it all, the Great Depression, with it's unrelenting desperation.And these are illustrated in a heckofa story. The plot doesn't just advance, it gallops, it whoops. It has romance, but not implausible romance. Jacob Jankowski is the protagonist, telling the story, with a great last-minute twist, in flashbacks that I thought were handled well. As a matter of fact, the only part of the story that was too unrealistic for me was Jacob's rush to run away from all he knew - to literally, though unintentionally, run away to join the circus. And there he meets Marlena, a circus star with her trained horse team, and Augustus, her equal parts charismatic and brutal husband.I very much recommend this novel.

This was the second book I read this year and so far, it's the best book I've read this year but it isn't as good as the reviews say it is. I enjoyed the bits about the old man's life more than I did than when he talked about his youth. Left lurching in an oldage home, this man tries to fend for himself when he's made to sit with a fellow gentleman he doesn't quite like. The only thing the old man knows is that he's old and even goes as far as wishing that the reader never gets to this age. The introduction of the novel is very good and it's easy to read although at times when he's reminiscing, you may get confused. The names of animals and humans can be a tad confusing. This book is a good bet for some while I can think of some people not liking this.Fellow casual readers, you're not missing much, try Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. However, for those with piqued interests, you must be wondering why your friends never spoke about this book, I wondered so too, only until I finished reading the book.

A33RNLOYCKBX3B,0002007770,"Heather Goodman ""heatheragoodman.com""",2,3,"Do you know how difficult it is to run and cry at the same time? Good books do that do me. And this was a good book.Brilliant, actually.That's the best way to describe it. The words themselves, the characterization, the anticipation. It's brilliant.Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is the story of Jacob Jankowski at twenty-three and at ninety (or ninety-three). At twenty-three, he ran away and joined the circus after his parents were killed in an accident. He had been studying to be a vet and was all but final exams. In the circus, Jacob encounters brutality, unexpected kindness, and love. At ninety (or ninety-three), Jacob's in a nursing home.The story fits well with Resurrection with it's themes of dignity, redemption, and anticipation. Twenty-three-year-old Jacob's Resurrection scene spread the resurrection and transformation to others. The Jacob in the end of the book is different from the Jacob in the beginning, and his transformation allows him to step in and fight for others. He may not always succeed in the way he desires, but he hands resurrection to others. It's a story about coming home.It's a story about dignity. Gruen frames the story so that you are hit by the fact that this old man, left to drool over Jello his last few years, is the twenty-three-year-old Jacob in the circus. These stories aren't just stories. They're stories of people we've forgotten about. It made me remember sitting at tea with my grandmother listening to her stories. I wish I'd written them down.It's about the dignity of the outcasts. In Depression-era America, especially on a circus, midgets, drunks, and the bottom-of-the-barrell working class were the outcasts. They weren't ""needed"" in society. They were easily disposed of. Because of this, Jacob becomes a Christ-figure restoring the dignity of a midget and a drunk, fighting for the oppressed, both human and animal.Gruen's strongest point, I think, is her ability to build anticipation. One scene captures it: Grady has (bad) news for Jacob. In waiting for Grady to spill it, Jacob notices the two drops of grease leaking from Grady's hamburger. Brilliance in these little details. The reader (namely, me) wants to shake Grady by the shoulders and scream at him to tell already!It's also about what Gruen doesn't write, where she holds back. I think as writers, sometimes we think we have to fill in every detail. For example, in a fight scene, Gruen doesn't give a blow-by-blow. Rather, she focuses on the confusion of the protag (Jacob), his swirling thoughts, a moment of pain here or there, his inability to stop hitting. Rather than observing the fight as you would a movie, you're caught up in the hero. I love this.",5,Water for Elephants,1212537600,"06 4, 2008"

AAYOK6NJN9KRH,0002007770,Heather M.,1,1,"I. SettingDepression era. The glory days of the circus. A time when a plethora of men out-of-work combined with a plethora of families looking for amusement and a modicum of freaks. Let's face it: throughout history, mankind has been sprinkled with a modicum of physical and mental freaks. Their ability to find job satisfaction fluctuates, but they're always out there.(Caveat: As a child in Wisconsin, I certainly attended a circus or two, and dutifully watched the now-defunct Great Circus Parade on TV, but have never visited the Circus World Museum in Baraboo. I am just as much an outsider as the rest of you, unless you are a Flying Wallenda, in which case I am a much bigger outsider.)The circus of Water for Elephants is the (name of circus), which is certainly a mouthful. To the eyes of this non-Flying Wallenda, it appears to be pretty typical of the time, especially once it gets an elephant. More on that later.II. PlotJust a brief synopsis here, since you have likely seen the film, read the book, or are planning to do so. Jacob Jankowski (protagonist), runs away to join the circus after his parents die in a car accident. Perhaps unwisely, he does so just before finishing his veterinary degree. He meets August, the bipolar head trainer. He falls in love with Marlena, August wife. After the circus picks up an elephant named Rosie, Jacob uses his profound understanding of animals (and the Polish language) to bond with her. And with Marlena. Since August is a total jackhole, though, this relationship is doomed.Luckily for everybody, the circus owner (Big Al) is known for cutting corners, and his spendthrift ways end in total calamity. The animals get loose, August is trampled to death, and Jacob sweeps Marlena off to live happily ever after. They have children, he works for a real circus (Ringling), and end up ditching the nursing home for yet another circus.III. CharactersI couldn't help but picture Robert Pattinson in my head as I read this book, and I hated that. Same for Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz. Nothing to be done, but I wish it had been left to my imagination.Though I found the premise a little unbelievable on the whole (literally running away to join the circus?), I did empathize with Jacob. Preparing for a profession that requires you to stick your hand up a cow's butt is hard enough. Once your parents are tragically killed? Forget about it.The Jacob/Marlena/August love triangle didn't convince me either, but perhaps that was residual cringing from Jacob's sexual awakening facilitated by the ladies of the cooch tent.(I should also apologize to the man sitting next to me on the bus that one day. Sir, if you happened to notice that I was reading about a man getting deflowered, I DO APOLOGIZE.)Honestly, the character I liked best was old Jacob. (No, my favorite was not the elephant. I did not cheer when she killed August, nor at the many times the reader was reminded that ELEPHANTS ARE PEOPLE TOO. Save it for Greenpeace.) Old Jacob, an imperfect narrator, combined the indignities of old age with a fierce desire to keep living. He doesn't remember how old he is, nor which of his many relatives was supposed to take him to the circus camped next to the nursing home. But he's feisty enough to scoot himself over when no one else will, and it's that same sort of self-determination that won us two world wars, darnit!*wipes tear from eye*Maybe I'm just nostalgic for the grandpa I never had. It's like that scene from The Royal Tenebaums, when Royal reads the gravestone of a man who died heroically on a sinking ship. The viewer is led to believe this is a relative of Royal's. He then says something like, ""What a man. I wish I knew him.""Well, I wish I knew Jacob Jankowsky. After he finished all that silliness with the circus.IV. StyleGruen uses a framing device, in which the bulk of the book is recalled through the eyes of the now-aged main character. The parallel? Present-day Jacob is eagerly anticipating a trip to the circus, whereas past-day Jacob worked many years on a circus. I do love the framing device, confusing as it is when you start the book. (More or less than in medias res? Discuss.)I appreciate a single protagonist/point of view kept constant throughout the book. I would not have liked to read a chapter told by Marlena, or the elephant, or the dwarf. It's hard enough keeping these people (and animals) straight with just one narrator.The ending was a little tidy for my taste--I kept expecting Marlena to miscarry or die in childbirth. That their long and productive union disappointed me probably speaks more to my own predilection for dystopian fiction (where EVERYBODY dies) than Gruen's storytelling abilities.The pacing was good, and you definitely knew when the book climaxed. I appreciated the real-life archival circus photographs scattered throughout, as well as the small details of circus life: the cookhouse flag, the water buckets, the segregation of performers and labor. Who knew that 50,000 people were paralyzed after drinking Jamaica ginger extract? Not me, even after watching the entire first season of Boardwalk Empire. HBO fail.Conclusion:Water for Elephants is a ""slice of life"" novel. In this case, Depression-era circus life. My criticisms aside, it's a worthy read. While researching this blog entry (ie reading the Wikipedia article), I learned that this novel originated in NaNoWriMo.

The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to ""run away"" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?

My favorite character was Rosie the elephant - because the narrator clearly loves her and therefore you love her.Apparently Gruen did vast research on the train circuses - making her use of jargon, lore and the incorporating of actual stories the core of the novel.As far as I can remember, this is the first time I read a book that provides insight from the perspective of an old person living in a nursing home or assisted living facility. Jacob's frustration at his body failing him and of people making decisions for him and treating him like a child, along with feelings of being abandoned and useless really got to me and were gently and movingly written.The magic comes in the highly improbable, yet tremendously satisfying ending.I definitely recommend the book.",5,Absolutely magical,1189036800,"09 6, 2007"

It's gripping and complex, with some wonderfully written supporting characters such as Walter, Camel, Uncle Al and Rosie the elephant. The tension slowly builds between the central characters, but is relieved with some laugh-out-loud moments from circus lore. The story is told in flashbacks from a 93 year old. There are some truly poignant moments at the nursing home. This is a really unique, well-done and entertaining book, and I liked that I couldn't guess the ending.Cons:Virtually non-existent and what there is is nitpicky, but here goes... It's written in present tense, which takes some getting used to. On p. 147: ""A black boy offers to shine my shoes.""  My 98-year-old grandmother uses the term ""colored"" and I believe that was the common term in the `30s and that ""black"" was a '60s term. Again, stupid nitpicky and doesn't detract from this fabulous book.Worth all of the hype, this is one of the best books I've read this year (and I've read a lot of books.)

It doesn&#8217;t suffer the fate of many, many novels &#8212; even some of my best loved &#8212; but there was something missing.That&#8217;s a convoluted way of saying I enjoyed it but it didn&#8217;t stick with me.Plot and pacing are excellent in this novel. I often write that most books need to be shorter. Novelists seem to always come up with a great opening. Better ones have great endings. Most fail in the middle. That middle third of most novels is such a bore to me. I think it&#8217;s filler to beef up a word count. I didn&#8217;t find this in Water for Elephants at all. Gruen can structure a story and keep the pace going. That&#8217;s a terribly hard thing to do and she pulled it off wonderfully.With one glorious exception, however, the characterization fell flat for me. Did I care about the characters? Kinda. Did I care about the romance? No. What did touch me was the role of the older Jacob. How this young, female writer climbed into the head of a ninety plus year old man, I&#8217;ll never know but his thoughts and actions rang true. He was facing death but still facing life and his inner monologue caused an almost claustrophobic feeling in myself. My god, I kept thinking. This could very well be me - trapped in a body, aware that I&#8217;m losing my mind to age and, most frightening of all, without the ability to do a damned thing about it. I hope to elicit that kind of reaction in a reader one day.The parts of the novel confined to an old man doing nothing much more than sitting in a wheelchair will stick with me for a while. I may go back and read those bits at times. The parts with the trains, circus, performances, midgets, elephants, romance and violence?

The characters were mostly stereotypical, ergo predictable.  I don't think giving the ending away in the prologue was such a great idea, because I spent the next 330+ pages waiting for something (anything!) to happen in that vein.  Instead I found myself wading through pages of the author describing events such as tent raising, etc..  The romantic scenes were very campy.  During the first several chapters when the book's format became aparent, I thought it was very fascinating to have the elder scenes interspersed with the circus scenes.  It turns out that they didn't add much to the story, or even make me want to keep reading.  The writing in the elder scenes was amusing, and soon those chapters became my reward for reading the cirucs chapters.  The ending was perhaps the most aggravating aspect of this book.  Something about Gruen's description of circus life and all its attendant characters makes me think it highly unlikely that a modern-day cirucs manager would embrace a decrepit old man and rescue him from life at the rest home.  Maybe it was all those descriptions of redlighting we were given...I'm not sure.

The setting transitions between the wild memories of working as a veterinarian for a travelling circus, set in the 1930s, and the protagonist's present life in a home for the elderly, lonely and unappreciated.  Themes of the book include romance, good vs evil, depression era desperation, and life in old age.The main character is a well studied near-graduate from an Ivy league school who loses everything after a catastrophe and feels he must run away and happens upon a circus train. He ends up working in very rough conditions to survive, and struggles with a love triangle that puts his life in peril.My personal affection for the book lies in the brutal conditions desperate people will endure, particularly for those who feel they have no place to go, as some of these characters do.  I'm also very fond of the contrast of how the elderly protagonist struggles with trivial tasks, like wanting to eat a crisp apple, while his younger self survived through such turbulent times.  Finally, the layout of the story, in which some details are revealed out of order through the time-transitions, enables the reader to piece certain details together before the main narrative gets to it feels like a device out of the movie Pulp Fiction (in a good way).This novel is written based off of actual and anecdotal incidents of circus life (as per the interview with the author contained in the back of the book).

It was an easy read and I was able to finish it in about 2 days. I loved the way it was written, the author did a great job of painting a picture. BUT the only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars were the parts that were written from the perspective of the 93 year old Jacob. Not that these parts were poorly written, they were actually very well written and made you feel like you were right there in the nursing home it just that well, one minute your enjoying circus life and the next minute BOOM your in a nursing home.

His parents are both killed in a tragic accident a week before his finals, and his professors do NOTHING to give him the benefit of the doubt on his exams?  Were incompletes a complete unknown in this time period?  (There's a lot more, but I'm trying to block it out....)  The main character himself seems to have virtually no inner life except a vague desire to get laid.  At one point he says he's interested in animals, but there sure no evidence of this.The entire first half of the book is exposition about circus life, with a long segment of gratuitous titillation thrown in.  I've got nothing against &#34;gritty&#34; and &#34;true to life&#34;.  However, I have no tolerance for scenes that are so obviously there only to sell the book as soft porn to an audience that wouldn't know literature if it hit them in the face.Characters are less 3-D than cardboard cut outs.  My dad's vague recollections of a circus coming to town when he was a kid in this time period were way more riveting.  At least they involved actual people, with real human motivations -- not characters who move from point A to B only because the author's outline said the plot had to move there.And present tense?  Throughout the entire book?  That's a device that should have been discarded in high school.  It does nothing but make me snicker at the author's obvious lack of writing talent.I had heard a rumor that this book was written as a NaNoWriMo project, and I can certainly believe it.  It seems to have been dashed off from a previously constructed outline, without any regard for building up characters and then modifying the plot if it made more sense for their motivations.  The present tense writing style is another give away that this was written in a rush and barely revised.  And the plonking in of vocabulary and &#34;facts&#34; willy-nilly -- stopping what little story there is in mid-stream -- kind of screams &#34;first draft&#34; all the way through.",1,Too much for my suspension of disbelief,1395187200,"03 19, 2014"

A3HZKNZY9KKQZA,0002007770,I LOVE BOOKS,1,1,"I loved this book. A tender love story recounted by a nonagenarian in present time.USA, 1930s. Jacob Jankowski had it all planned out: about to become a veterinarian, looking forward to join his father's practice, fate disrupts everything. Almost overnight, he is employed in a circus, the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Animals love him and he loves animals, but not only. He falls in love for the very first time in his life. But love, just like wild animals, can be dangerous if one is not too careful, and it slowly dawns on him that all the glittery world of a circus is not always what it seems...The book is written in alternating chapters between present day and the past. The present day is represented touchingly, moving in a few parts, although the main character Jacob, now mostly sitting on a wheelchair with a few aches and pains, still has a sense of humour and a passion for life that is uplifting. He is now ninety. Or ninety-three.The chapters about his past are absorbing and mesmerizing not only because of him falling in love for the first time with lovely Marlene, they also offer an engaging insight of circus life, the workers, the animals, and what is behind all those lights and delights. Very interesting.So drum roll please. Let the show begin Ladies and Gentlemen.

The author, Sara Gauen researched boxcar circuses before writing Water, the societal environment of the depression, attitudes toward circus workers by owners, treatment of the animals in the menageries and how they were obtained during the depression era then rapped everything into the lives of her main characters, add to this the breaking of the sexual mores frowned on by society, mix, and you have a recipe that makes for good reading.  The best thing about Water is the telling of the story by Jacob Jankowski, who is a 90 or 93 year old Vet depending on how you look at it, now confined in a residential nursing home and looking back into his past.

A55RQ26WDPSM0,0002007770,Iusedtobeacat,0,1,"I read this book a while back and I must agree with every 1,2 stars reviewer out there it is Overrated, plain and simple. I know a lot of people are interested in reading this book because of the recent Major Motion Picture starring Rob Pat and Reese Witherspoon.Oh, Well the premise of the story is quite interesting, an almost college graduate who runs away after his parents tragic death (nope this is not a spoiler it's in the back cover) only to join a traveling circus where he goes from a stable boy to the circus vet in a course of (well less than a year), and falls in love with a married showgirl named Marlena who is suffering under her abusive husband August (who is described as being schizophrenia but every psychologist will tell you he's just an aggressive, controlling jerk with anger management problems).So, this book has all the elements possible to make it a good read, Adventure, Romance, Drama, and forbidden love Blah Blah Blah !Adventure, Hardly ! Action (Well apart from the few scenes of hopping in and out of trains there's hardly any to count), Romance & Forbidden love ? (the romance element although seems to sum up a big part of the story even bigger than the circus is so contrived, lacking and unrealistic. The characters hardly hold a conversation to make us believe they belong together, I didn't care if Marlena and Jacob separated for life ! Actually I found myself hoping they would just to spice up the book from its predictable ultimate boring ending and I'm a person who loves happy endings) Circus Life ? Well, Yeah its there all right but the writing doesn't allow it to come to life. I never felt transported to the 193os, I never felt that I was in a circus. The descriptions were unfortunately very flat.The characters are the biggest disappointment in the book. They are two-dimensional at best as well as stereotypical. The Good guys are innocent, nice and bearing all the sufferings of the world on their shoulders and the bad guys are greedy jerks and a$$holes who only care about profit and the $$$ money !Some people were complaining about the Over the top sex scenes, Ahh, O.K ! I'm used to reading romance books heavy on sex scenes and this one doesn't even come close. I don't mind sex in books as long as there is a reason to it and as long as it is beautifully written. In here the characters are just flat out boring that they make sex and murder boring.Obviously none of them is sympathetic even Jacob who just lost his parents, we never get insight into his soul. We never knew for sure why or how was he driven by depression and shock after his parents death to leave all his life behind him and join a circus, we never even know how he recovered from the lost of his parents because he never show any signs of being sad or depressed. Marlena on the other hand, well she is in an abusive relationship so its O.K that she cheats on her husband with Jacob. It would've been rather interesting if her husband was actually a good man but she fell out of love with him and ran away with Jacob leaving the circus. Now that would've been a better conclusion !This book/author does the fatal mistake of telling instead of showing. We are told that this and that happens but we are never shown and therefore never transported. I give it 2 stars for entertainment value and because it was a fairly easy/fast paced book to read.

A3HIHCG2PJ49WM,0002007770,"Jack Kruse ""For Unofficial Use Only""",1,3,"***SPOILER ALERT***Put this novel on the FUN READ shelf. Definitely nothing mind-blowing in terms of plot or prose but a very entertaining look at depression era circus life.The author alternates (for the most part) chapters between Jacob's life during the depression and his life as a 90 year old in a nursing home. One gets the sense that the author seeks to evoke some sympathy for the 90 year Jacob's plight. In this endeavor she fails as she never fully fleshes out his relationship with his children. Thus the reader is left feeling slightly apathetic as to his plight as a lonely and ornery old man wasting away in a assisted living facility.Finally, the ending is a bit contrived and convenient. The frail old Jacob making a break for it out of the retirement home and going to the circus event that is in town. There of course he meets and befriends one of the circus directors who spirits him away on their cross country tour. Happily ever blah blah blah.All of this is not to discourage someone from reading this novel. The author can write with rhythm and keeps the pacing light and quick. Viewing the novel as a love story, the author is adept at capturing the dual emotional nature of love with phrases like: ""exhausted and recharged, desperate and fulfilled."" With a good writer, this book would make a great movie.",3,Fun read and one day a GREAT movie!,1276214400,"06 11, 2010"

A2XK04SBBC164A,0002007770,Jacob's Beloved,1,1,"This is one of those books that I read because I loved the movie first. So, I was quite surprised when I read how the book begins - with the murder of one of the main characters. When I further realized that August does not own the Benzini Brothers, I began to see the movie as its own story separate from the book.Jacob is by far the most interesting character of the book, especially since he tells the story as an old man in a nursing home - and has the wisdom and experience to go with his age. His emotions are infectious and I longed to sit down with him and listen to all of his stories in person way before I finished the book.August is the kind of villain that is confusing in his evil deeds - he has schizophrenia - which makes it somewhat unfair to dislike him so much. His irrational behavior has been exploited for the almighty dollar by Uncle Al - but the real villain tends to fade into the background.Marlena is beautiful to the point of angelic, very little of what she does can be considered wrong in any way, as she is a victim struggling for freedom for most of the book. She approaches August's mood swings with the same caution due a wild animal, and remains faithful to him despite her personal feelings, and does not leave until he first betrays her. Considering how women today will leave their husbands for any reason, I admire her strong morals.The background is set during the Great Depression, which made for many intense situations as the circus struggled to profit, as well as the survival of the cast of characters. Though I studied this period in American history, the direct experience gave me a clearer idea of the desperation of people alive during this time - how easily morals could be put on hold for the sake of another mouthful of food or another coin in the pocket. So many men of the circus would work without pay for the promise of another meal and unending hope that life could still improve.Rosie, the elephant, is also one of the most fascinating characters in the book. She proved to be only one example of how animals were exploited to the point of cruelty for profit. I could not help wondering where the animal activists were.Needless to say, this book sparked many conversations and inspired many moments of personal contemplation for me. I loved this book, and I highly recommend it.",5,A Great Conversation Piece,1342224000,"07 14, 2012"
A2CJG8SY7P8BQT,0002007770,Jacquee,1,2,"Note: There are some vague and some blatant spoilers within my review.Water for Elephants was extraordinary, but what really made this book stand out was Gruen's extensive research behind the story line. It is impossible for me to name how many books I've read in which historical accuracy was nonexistent. More and more authors these days are throwing in unlikely happenings into their works to spice them up with a complete disregard of the line between fact and fantasy. This was not the case in this book. There were many instances where I cringed because the author would describe a scene I considered extremely unlikely, only to find out in the last few pages that they were all completely true, as Gruen had collected them from many historical resources. These include the pickled hippo, the way August died, and Rosie's human characteristics. The author made sure it was true to its time, adding in mentions of the prohibition, and scenes of the effects of the Great Depression.As for the characters, I considered them very well developed, and I quickly grew attached. Camel and Walter being thrown from the train still haunts me. Marlena finally broke out of her dysfunctional submission to her wicked husband, and Jacob slowly returned from his deep depression. The cause of death for August and Big Al became much more fascinating as I learned in the last couple of pages that both deaths were inspired by true events from a circus many years ago. Gruen utilized pathos perfectly to bond me to Rosie, Jacob, Camel, Walter, Marlena, and even Queenie, very quickly.I was more than satisfied with the ending. Jacob finding a second chance was the only way I would be able to leave the novel happy. His other choices would have been either dying lonely without a family visit, or continuing to live on in the rest home he detested. Either way, Jacob would have ended up miserable. Whether or not I find it likely a young circus manager would accept an old veterinarian who limped himself away from a retirement home, I will not mention.The explicit sex scenes were my only gripe. They were often pointless and contributed nothing to the plot whatsoever. I will give Gruen some credit, and acknowledge the fact that without them, the author would have glossed over a very real aspect of circus life, but at the same time, I was disgusted by the descriptions that Gruen seemed to enjoy prolonging. There was quite a bit of cursing, but seeing as that is another aspect of every day, adult conversation, it did not bother me much.Water for Elephants was an extremely pleasant read. I couldn't put it down, and the characters are still a part of me as well as their story. The book analyzed a part of American history- the circus- I have never even considered, and remained true to its time. I learned so much about an American culture that is never recognized in textbooks. I would recommend this book in a heart beat.",5,Excellent; Included all that a good novel should and very historically insightful,1335225600,"04 24, 2012"
A1Z48CZB1SOKE6,0002007770,"Jacqueline Carney ""http://wordsnwags.blogspot...",0,0,"Sara Gruen's WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, released in 2006, is a multi-dimensional novel I strongly recommend. It's delightfully romantic story is set in the last depression (to separate it from our current one!) told from the memory of 93-year-old Jacob Jankowski whose parents are killed during his last semester of Veterinary School in New York. Though he had planned to join his father's thriving veterinary practice, Jacob learns his parents had mortgaged everything they owned to send him to school and his father's practice was dissembled by creditors to pay their debts.Penniless and unable to concentrate on his final exams Jacob runs off to seek solace and winds up on the train of a dysfunctional circus at a time when any job at all, no matter how horrific, was worth keeping.For seven years Jacob found his love of all creatures, his high moral standards and his passion for Marlena at life-threatening odds with his superiors whose personality issues ranged from wanton narcissism to murderous greed.Jacob is now a spunky old man whose mind is stronger than his body and who rails against the inane rules of the nursing home he calls home. He rarely recognizes his infrequent family visitors but remembers in finite detail his days in the circus. Sara Gruen deftly carries the story from Jacob's current frustrations back to his luscious recollections of what once was. His longing for his beloved Marlena, a beautiful equestrian and star of the show whom he eventually marries but who passes before him, sugar coats his memories that are not always so pleasant.The third dominant character is Rosie, an elephant purchased for her promise to redeem the circus's failing revenues and who placidly endures her terrible abuse until her own sense compassion is uncontrollably violated.What endeared me to this story was Sara's wonderful understanding of people and what motivates them to make bad choices. She juxtaposes horrendous cruelty against unbounded compassion but the last page left me with confidence that goodness is master and that all creatures, animal and human, deserve and benefit from it. Her research into a world of human and animal oddities, foreign to most of us, is thorough and her sense of humor softens the sharp edges of an often-wicked world.The circus world is a microcosm from our past but its 'rubes' and its stars teach lessons in WATER FOR ELEPHANTS that are universal and current with a pace that grabbed me within the first few pages and held me captive until the end.",5,The Bright Side of A Depression,1240531200,"04 24, 2009"

His parents are both killed in a car accident and finds out that his parents have mortaged everything to pay for his tuition at Cornell Vet school.  Figuring that he is unable to continue his education and he jumps on a train in the middle of the night running away from everything he had known.  The train that he winds up on is a circus train.He befriends several individuals and winds up working for the outfit.  One particular person is a married woman named Marlena.  Jacob's boss is Marlena's husband, August.  August is a bit off mentally to say the least.One of the most remarkable and memorable characters in the book is an elephant that the circus aquired named Rosie.  When she is first aquired August believes she is dumbest animal on earth because she would not do anything that they tried to get her to do.  Because of this August beats Rosie on a regulart basis until Jacob by accident discovers that she only understands commands given to her in Polish.  After that discovery Rosie is the star of the show alongside of Marlena.Things don't stay rosy for long.  August has more fits, ex circus employee's who were thrown off the train catch up, and performers get sick and tired of what has been happening.

One thing I DIDN'T call 100 pages in was a 93 year old running off to join the circus. Know why? Because it's so ridiculous as to be impossible. I'm calling shenanigans.If the point was to realistically show how brutal circuses were, carry it to it's final conclusion: kill someone we like, not just the people who deserve it or animals without names. There was obviously a lot of (what must have been fascinating) research that went into this book. But even that was thrown in my face. Every time there was something I didn't understand, a character blatantly explained it right away rather than allowing me to just figure it out based on context clues and subtle writing.Overall, very soap-opera and melodramatic.

Jacob Jankowski recounts his youthful exploits with the Benzini Brother circus after his parents were killed in an accident and he is left with any money.At that time, he was attending veterinary college but decides to leave it and takes his knowledge of animals and joins the circus. I found great empathy in Gruen's work for the odd characters that perform in the circus and in the love between a special elephant and Jacob.I recommend this book as a delightful read and also check outThe Kite Runnerby Khaled Hosseini which is tragic tale of Afghanistan and his recent bookA Thousand Splendid Sunsalso dealing with Afghanistan.

A1VF5UZFUQOVY0,0002007770,Jane Anderson,17,25,"When this book is telling the story of the circus, it is fascinating, describing a world that most readers know nothing about. But, possibly in an attempt to make it more ""commercial"", the author has chosen to focus on the love story, which is predictable. In those scenes, fascination turns to boredom.Use all that research (described in detail at the end of the book), Ms Gruen, to tell us more stories of the roustabouts, performers, animals and freaks of the circus - and forget the ""plot"" and the soap!",3,"Fun, but not wonderful",1164758400,"11 29, 2006"
AP2HMJP71Z0G9,0002007770,Jane Austen 777,0,0,"I found this book interesting because of the research Ms. Gruen obviously did on train circuses and depression-era life. I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book. Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here. The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider. We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains. Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and ""Uncle Al"", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page. For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish. I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well. Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater. He's simply too many things rolled into one. Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable. And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic. Perhaps if she'd actually used the ""show, don't tell"" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional. As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man. One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do. Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook. It's hard to respect a character like that. Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram. In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action. I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story. Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book 4 stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man. I also really got a kick out of the ending. But on the whole, I would recommend this as a library book or a used book store book -- definitely NOT one you pay full price for.",4,A beautiful song with some off notes,1302998400,"04 17, 2011"

She named several books for me including Water for Elephants, which she insisted was great.  I was hesitant because it was not shelved in the romance section, but I tried it.  I figured romance readers must like this nonromance book, for her to suggest it.  Fiction lovers might rate this 4 or 5 stars, but since it is not my preferred genre, I gave it 3 stars which simply means ""I liked it.""  It was an interesting piece of fiction.  There were a variety of interesting and different types of characters including bad guys, good guys and friendships.  I enjoyed it, and I learned what circus life was like in 1931 including interactions with the animals.  I assume the author was reasonably historically accurate regarding circus life at that time.The story is told from Jacob's perspective when he was in his early 20s and in his early 90s.  Shortly before he was to graduate from Cornell veterinary school, his parents died, and the bank took all their property.  Jacob was too upset to sit for his final exams.  He left school and got a job with the Benzini Brothers circus, acting as vet for the animals.  He spent 3  months with that circus.  The elephant Rosie had a wonderful role.  Jacob developed a relationship with Marlena who was married to August the animal trainer.  August was physically abusive to animals, Marlena and others.Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: two.  Setting: 1931 and around 2001 circus traveling within the U.S.  Copyright: 2006.

A2WI61YY7J1FE2,0002007770,Jarod Wilson,1,3,"I think that most people seem to either love this novel or hate it, but I have a hard time stirring myself to care much either way.  It is by no means a standout book, but neither is it so horrible that I couldn't force myself through it.The best writing in the book, I think, are the sequences with Jacob as an old man.  They ring true, and have a poignancy regarding the lives and treatment of the elderly that stirs some guilty discomfort.  Leaving aside the over-the-top, sappy, happy Hollywood ending, these sequences are satisfying and believable.The larger narrative, that of Jacob in his twenties, also has an air of authenticity, at least in terms of feeling (to an outsider) like a dingy, dangerous, depression-era circus.  It is successful at creating a strong sense of the world.  But I never found myself getting wrapped up in the stories of any of the individual characters.  In other words, I just didn't get pulled in.Some people probably take offense at the blatant sexuality of a handful of scenes, and at the mistreatment of animals in several more.  I am not personally bothered by these, as they are pertinent to the story, but neither do they stir me to care much about the outcome of the story.  In the end, it was an easy read with a vivid world, but lacking (for me) much character-driven interest.  So I'm on the fence about whether I like it or not.

It was inspiring to hear.Yet it took me years to get around to reading this book despite many recommendations.I LOVED it!The author did a lovely job of handling so many characters big and small. She kept solid control over their little quirks, tics, etc.I particularly enjoyed seeing everything first-person present through Jacob's eyes, but I do think he was more of a woman's man than a man's man. Not that I need him to be a boar or a brute, but he was a touch more on the emotional swing side than I generally like in male characters in stories of this ilk.Didn't really matter though, because the whole package of this tale enchanted me.Wholeheartedly recommend (but be prepared to be disappointed with the movie if you read the book first).",4,Well executed and entertaining story,1305676800,"05 18, 2011"

A2HSOCCYA8E0CB,0002007770,"Jay Gilbertson ""Published Author""",1,1,"Water for Elephants""A Novel, Written By Sara GruenBook Review by Jay GilbertsonWho, in their right mind, doesn't like the circus? If you answered ""yes,"" then this book is for you. If you answered ""no"" then this book is for you too. There is something for everyone in this tremendously well-researched novel of schizophrenic madmen, a possible murderer in pink sequins and a towering heroine who happens to be addicted to lemonade. What could be more fun?A depression-era circus can be the best place to be if you're Jacob Jankowski and you just buried your parents, found out they mortgaged everything they owned to send you off to veterinary college and ultimately you had nothing left to lose.Some of the central themes of this page-turner are to follow your instincts, stay true to what you believe in and try to survive no matter what. It's the what part that kept me flying through the book. The story shifts back and forth from Jacob at ninety (or ninety-three--he's not sure) to his incredible life on the train with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth--the circus! By incredible, I mean that there is a constant fear-factor woven underneath every nuance, every situation is rubbed raw in not ever being entirely sure of just what the future holds, or even if Jacob has one. That dread is dolled out in buckets-full by the head honcho of Benzini Brothers--Uncle Al--who can have you ""red-lighted"" (tossed off the train) for any number of indiscretions, or simply to lesson the load. The incredible part is that, in the end, Jacob not only manages to become the circus veterinarian, he also gets the girl, a bereaved dog, one elephant (Rosie) and eleven horses. Who could ask for more, you ask? Jacob Jankowski, that's who.Then there are the animals. A team of ""Liberty"" horses, lions and zebras and llamas, giraffes, chimps, panthers, and Rosie--the elephant--the Polish elephant no less. The elephant that, like all elephants, drinks far more water than anyone could ever imagine carrying, which is one of many parables in this fast-paced tale.Did I mention the train? Benzini Brothers traveled exclusively by steam-train. The train becomes a powerful force that literally grabs up entire, failing circuses in its path and absorbs them like the little fish being eaten by the bigger one.Think shark.Uncle Al is a ""take no prisoners"" kind of fellow, unless he can get you for a song. Then he owns your soul.The secondary story line, that of old Jacob looking back on his days with the circus, added a depth to this novel rarely seen in most modern literature. He may not know his exact age, but there is a spark of life in him not quite ready to waste away in the nursing home that has become his prison. Then a circus comes to town and begins to set up shop right next door to the nursing home. It's an opportunity that Jacob simply can't resist.You won't believe what happens next...",5,Oh My Gosh---Finally---A Happy Ending/Begining...,1281657600,"08 13, 2010"

The details of circus life were fascinating and disturbing, and seemed quite real.  The descriptions of animal care were amazing.  To be honest I'd never contemplated how all the humans and animals were fed and housed in a circus- what a feat, even compared to ""the Spec""!I found the passages with Jacob as an old man convincing and touching.The only thing I didn't find convincing was the romance between young Jacob and Marlena.  The relationship between Jacob and the circus couple Marlena and August was too similar to the triangle in ""Sophie's Choice"", a superior novel.  Stingo, Sophie and Nathan could have stood in for our three characters here, esp August as the schizophrenic, charming, Jewish genius.  I just couldn't get the superimposed images out of my mind and so found that part of the book less effective.  I had to keep reminding myself that Marlena and Jacob were contemporaries in age, which also kept escaping me.Strange to read a book where I'd much rather read about the relationship between a young man and an extraordinary elephant than about the (human) love of his life!",4,"Lovely, mostly....",1150156800,"06 13, 2006"

Ah, Rosie.

The first few pages held my interest (mildly) and I struggled to read the next few chapters. After about five or six I ended up skimming through most of the book. Certainly some of Ms. Gruen's descriptions of circus life are interesting and make for an unsual setting and back drop...but I felt most of the characters were flat and lacked emotional depth. The last chapter held my interest some and I found it easy to pick up on it even though I skimmed. This tells me the middle didn't make an impact on me. Maybe more dialogue was needed, I don't know.

The train happens to be that of the Flying Squadron of the Benzi Brothers Greatest Show On Earth, a middle-of-the-road depression era circus. Jacob earns a job as the circus' vet, caring for a small menagerie of animals.The story is told by a 90- or 93-year-old (he can't remember which) Jacob living in a nursing home many years later. And although this aspect adds depth to Jacob's character, it dragged a little for me. However, the main story, that of Jacob's adventure with the circus, is full of energy. Parts of his romantic involvement with one of the circus performers felt a little predictable, but most of the story was engrossing. Gruen's meticulous research shows throughout the book.

This is the first book I have read from this author and I found myself interested in the book from the first sentence.The main character (Jacob Jankowski) starts the story as a 90 (or is that 93?) year old man in a nursing home living out his life. He is unhappy and realizes that his kids and the world have forgotten him. He then thinks back to his early adult life when he was in school to become a veterinarian. He takes us back to those years of the Great Depression and the adventures he had while working for a small traveling circus.The book never lets you down and the characters that Jacob Jankowski meets will keep you interested. It is a book that, in my opinion, lays open the human experience. At times, the book takes a romantic and even very sensual tone. At other times, the cruelty of the Great Depression and the desperation of people who worked hoping for some type of income or food will remind you of the harsh life of those times.The book spends some time going back and forth from present day to the days when Jacob Jankowski was part of the circus.

I'll admit the main reason why I looked into it was because I saw the movie trailer and I wanted to know what it was about.

I wasn't too sure about it at first, but after looking on those other sites, I figured I'd give it a chance, wow am I glad I did.The book has so much too it, it's very well rounded. The love story is darling and the main character is easy to fall in love it. Sara Gruen is an amazing writer. From the moment I started reading this book I couldn't and didn't want to put it down. It's been awhile since I've read a book that has left me feeling fully satisfied. It's romantic and has the love story in it. It's great in the flashbacks it does for the main character. The older version of him is witty and cynical. The story has it's tough moments as well, with fights, and the intricate lifestyle of a circus in this time period. I found it to be a truly entertaining read. There is so much going on in it, but it's still connected very well, there are no loose ends.

AKON7YTSYRU2Y,0002007770,"J. Conrad Guest ""J. Conrad Guest""",2,3,"An interesting premise, Water for Elephants: a melodrama that takes place in a traveling circus during the first half of the last century. Throw in forbidden love, an abusive husband, murder, and a few other plot twists, and you're assured a best-seller followed by a Hollywood movie with a topnotch cast.I went to the circus as a boy; I never wanted to run away with it, but I enjoyed it; then again, I never feared clowns.I've had Water for Elephants on my reading list for more than a year; it was highly recommended to me but it just kept getting pushed down on my reading list. Finally, with the movie due out, I opted to make reading it a priority.I won't say I didn't enjoy it, but I can't say either that it's deserving of all the accolades it's received. Author Sara Gruen obviously had a passion for the circus, as evidenced by the research that went into this piece and the period.Normally I enjoy melodramas--Victor Hugo's Laughing Man comes to mind. But Elephants, for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, just missed.Maybe it's just me. Some call Romeo and Juliet the greatest love story ever written. I happen to think it's the most overrated piece of literature ever penned. I mean, come on, Romeo falls instantly in love with Juliet the first time he ever lays eyes on her, and only after they part does he realize he forgot to ask her for her name. Can true love be founded on such a shallow premise? No, he's just reacting to hormones. It's young love, which is not really love at all, merely lust.At first I thought it was because Ms. Gruen wrote the piece from the perspective of a male protagonist, and like a lot of cross-gender writing, it somehow lacks a certain authenticity. But Jacob is a likeable enough young man, flawed; recently orphaned, he joins the circus to what we in the 21st century would say, ""Find himself."" He certainly is attracted to Marlena, initially, for all the reasons a 20-year-old young man would be: she looks great in her pink sequined riding costume.But it wears old after a while--we want to see a relationship grow between them. What the story reveals is that Marlena, married, suffers from Battered Woman Syndrome. Her husband is mentally unbalanced and jealous to the point of insanity. He accuses her of infidelity with Jacob even though nothing has happened--except in their own mercenary hearts.Well, we were ready to impeach Jimmy Carter for admitting he'd lusted after women in his heart. Even the bible teaches that if your thoughts are impure, if you're unfaithful in your mind, you're just as guilty as if you'd committed the act. But nothing has happened between these two innocents except a shared kiss. But because her husband is such a beast we accept that it is okay and feel sympathetic toward Marlena since she is committed to make it work with her unbalanced husband because her parents previously told her, when she wanted to come home after admitting to them the marriage had been a mistake, that she had to lie in the bed she'd made.Yet I found neither Jacob nor Marlena very sympathetic; neither character was very memorable, even if the writing was sharp, crisp and authentic to the period. My sympathies lay with Rosie, the poor elephant who suffered such abuse at the hands of Marlena's husband she, the elephant that is, eventually killed him.Now that I've had more than a week to think about Elephants, to capture what seems to be an elusive reason for my indifference to this book, it occurs to me that a lot of books these days are written in this fashion, they expect the reader to connect with the character in their own way.I understand what that means and I don't disagree with it--until it's taken to an extreme and I'm presented with cardboard characters, caricatures.I want to connect with characters, not become them. I want to see how others respond to adversity. I can always later compare what I would've done, how I would've thought, were I in those circumstances.I guess, in the end, that's what was missing for me in Elephants: I just couldn't connect with Jacob or Marlena.Or, maybe at my age I just don't get young love anymore.",3,Nice Scope; Characters Fall Flat,1304899200,"05 9, 2011"

A3RP1I0SL7091Q,0002007770,jeanne-scott,12,14,"Water For Elephants tells the story of one man's life with the circus as the backdrop to all of his experiences.Jacob is a student studying to become a veterinarian when his parents are killed in an accident and he is left with no family, no money  and he walks away from that life.  He ends up picking up some work with a traveling circus and his life takes a turn that he never anticipated.  He becomes a part of the circus family (as dysfunctional as can be..........but they put the fun in dysFUNctional!)Jacob recalls his life, while he is over 90 years old and relegated to a nursing home. A nurse mentions that the circus is in town and everyone will have the opportunity to attend a show. As he sits at a dinner table with several other elderly folks, one man looking to gain attention from the women makes the claim that he ""..used to carry the water for the elephants.""  Jacob calls him a liar, because Jacob knows the amount of water that an elephant consumes, and those vast quantities could not be carried by one man.  When a nurse asks if Jacob worked in a circus he does not answer her, and that is when his memories are brought to life.  As he waits for his outing, the days pass and he relives the last 70+ years of his life in his mind.  The stories that are told about how the circus works, the value that is placed on the money coming in, the care or lack there of, for the animals, the living conditions on the trains for the circus workers...........all these things and more come alive in Jacob's tale.While it seems that the story starts a bit hesitantly, soon the reader is caught up in the tale, what happens to the different people, the relationship between the ""stars"" and the workers, many aspects of a traveling circus are revealed, even in the treatment of the animals!This story is an interesting portrayal of life in a traveling circus, and the ending is an unexpected one that takes you unaware.This is Sara Gruen's first novel and she is nominated for two Quill writing awards.",4,Circus life revealed through the memories of Jacob,1161820800,"10 26, 2006"

Knowing nothing about the circus, and also very sad for circus animals in general, I was not sure that this book would appeal to me.  However, this book was so well written, and the facts that were used in the making of this book really kept me intrigued.The story of a young man named Jacob whose life changes in an instant when his parents are killed and he is left with nothing just days before he graduates from Cornell.  The lifelong dream of working alongside his father as a vet is instantly shattered as he learns he is left with nothing because, unbeknownst to Jacob his parents were flat broke.  Jacob ends up hitching a ride hobo style, on a circus train, and the ride of his life begins.  This journey will take you all over the country by way of train, living with the freaks and the performers, the working men, and, of course, the animals.Told by Jacob, now a 93 year old man living in a assisted living retirement community - which he hates.  He still has his wits about him, his mind is sharp, and that makes it hard for him to accept his age. His body just isn't what it used to be and having to use a walker and a wheelchair makes him downright angry.  The passion in which he tells his life story makes this book very captivating.

I kept hearing great things about it, but I just had no interest in reading about a circus. Then I saw the movie preview... and knew I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie (I'm rarely able to finish a book if I see the movie first). So I started reading, and had a hard time getting into it at first... I think this was mainly because I felt like I HAD to read the book... as if I was back in school! I eventually got past this and was able to get immersed into Water for Elephants.Usually, I rate books by how I feel while reading them, so my ratings are normally always subjective. In this case, I felt I had to give this book 5 stars based on the fantastic writing and the amazingly rich and unique backdrop of the train circus! It is obvious that the author did her research on circus culture and depression-era American history. She really dug into the down and dirty details of circus life. In the discussion after the last chapter you learn that many things in the story are based on true stories or anecdotes of the circus. The Bezini Brothers train circus is easily like another character in the book, flawed and deeply layered, like the characters themselves. I really liked how the story is told from Jacob's perspective as a spunky 93 year old man, having flashbacks of his life 70 year earlier. The altering perspectives (from young to old) effectively grounded the story and added another layer to his character.At times, this wasn't easy to read... It was sad to read about the indignities of being old, and I felt like Gruen's depiction was honest and very real. Though most of all, I had a really hard time reading some of the scenes with the animals. At one point I caught myself reading between my fingers, as if I was trying to block the scene from view as if it was a movie. I tried skipping over one but I had to go back and read it because I felt like it was important to the development of the characters and the story. It was, and they were.

I'd seen the movie before I actually picked up this book, But I was so impressed by the movie I decided i'd take the chance to sit back and read it. Let me say it made my morning commute to work far easier. I adore this book and have already passed it on to someone else in my family. It is one of those books that i was thinking was going to be completely different to the movie, and although there are a few sizable differences, it followed the plot extremely well.We first meet Jacob a ninety something withering old man remembering the good old days when he used to be able to do whatever, whenever.. and eat basically anything he wanted. Something the nursing home wasn't allowing him to do, much to his dismay. Flicking back between old Jacob and young Jacob we're presented with some humorous banter before delving into the heart wrenching tale of his life. I felt as though i'd been thrust back in time, and was there along with them at the circus, watching everything fall in to place. It all flowed so smoothly.The author did her research, she slipped right into that era without any troubles and i found it pleasant and enjoyable. A great summer read that leaves you devouring the pages wondering what is going to happen next. I highly recommend reading this.

I love when a book does that, and makes me both happy and sad, and this book does both of these things at various points.  The most emotional aspect of the book for me was how Jacob felt about being in a nursing home, his frustration at having a ""young"" mind in an older body, and being treated as though he's senile by the nursing home staff as well as his own family.  This happens a lot in our culture, we tend to pack away the old because we don't want to be reminded of what we will be one day.

I was not disappointed.  This is the story of a man who is looking back on his life and how his actions helped him become the man he became.  After the death of his parents he jumps a freight train only to discover it is a circus train.  He was one exam away from becoming a veterinarian at the time of his families death and his time with the circus not only helped form his view of the world but also his view of mankind and himself.  It was moving, the characters were 3 dimensional and grew during the telling of this tale.  I couldn't put it down.  The ending was very unexpected and I found myself wondering when it was all said and done what happened next.  Although this was not in a genre I normally read I would highly recommend it.  I am an animal lover and his compassion for the beast that were used by the circus was very touching.  I found myself routing for the good guys and hating the bad guys and thinking to myself  I could so see myself doing that.  There are things that happen in everyone's life that shape them, change them and help them become the people they are meant to be. This story will touch your heart and make think back over your own life with new perspective. I give it two thumbs up a must read for anyone who has ever loved and lost or who has wondered what if?

It was so descriptive that I could hear the circus music playing.There was a few boring spots, but when the book picks up the tempo, it makes up for the few boring parts. Also I didn't like how the prolog made it seem like Marlena murdered August, when it turns out to be Rosie the Elephant. That was the books Far-fetched moment.

Even in your twenties you know how old you are. I'm twenty-three, you say, or maybe twenty-seven. But then in your thirties something strange starts to happen. It's a mere hiccup at first, an instant of hesitation. How old are you? Oh, I'm--you start confidently, but then you stop. You were going to say thirty-three, but you're not. You're thirty-five. And then you're bothered, because you wonder if this is the beginning of the end. It is, of course, but it's decades before you admit it.""Jacob lives in a nursing home--a bit of a grumpy old man but he does OK overall. He likes to give the nurses a hard time every so often. He resents having to eat Jell-O and the other soft food they try to pass off in the dining room. But his mind is drifting a bit; sometimes he finds himself in vivid dreams--and wakes to find himself unsure of where he is and why he is there. And when a circus sets up shop near the nursing home, Jacob's mind begins to wander more--back to when he was a young man of twenty-three. Back when he knew exactly how old he was. Back when his life lay before him like a blank canvas.He was studying to be a veterinarian. Unbeknownst to Jacob, his parents had mortgaged themselves to the hilt to put him through vet school. The idea was for Jacob to return home and join his father in the family practice--E. Janokowski and Son, Doctors of Veterinary Medicine. But on the brink of graduation, Jacob is called out of class. His parents have been killed in a car accident.  He's alone in the world. He returns home to bury his parents and finds that his legacy--the vet practice--is gone. It is the Great Depression and like others, his parents had fallen on hard times and there is nothing left--the bank claims it all.Although Jacob returns to school to sit for his final exam, he walks out without completing it, follows a road down to the train tracks, and hops onto a passing train--a n action that changes everything. For this isn't an ordinary train--it is the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob has landed on a circus train.A less profitable and more shady circus than Ringling, the Benzini Brothers circus is its own society--populated by two basic social castes: the Performers and the Working Men. They live their lives on the circus train--crisscrossing the country and setting up in various small towns around America. With his veterinary background, Jacob soon finds himself in charge of the menagerie--the collection of animals that perform in the circus. From horses to tigers to monkeys, Jacob cares for the animals with compassion and concern--doing the best he can in difficult circumstances. (After all, when even the men don't get paid some days, there isn't much money for animal food.)He is befriended by a married couple who perform in the circus. Marlena is the beautiful star who performs with the Liberty Horses. August--Marlena's tempermental husband--is the equestrian director and superintendent of animals (in other words, Jacob's boss). Jacob is instantly smitten with Marlena but works hard to conceal his feelings--August has a dark temper that can flare unexpectedly. At first Jacob can control his attraction, but when the circus takes on Rosie--an elephant--things become complicated.The fates of Jacob, Rosie, Marlena and August become forever intertwined--linked together by love, hate, jealousy and violence. How this story plays out forms the core of the book--taking a path that is full of twists, turns and surprises.My ThoughtsSara Gruen does a brilliant job of creating a world that I've never read about before--the world of a traveling circus train in Depression-era America. What a colorful and fascinating setting this was. Gruen does a wonderful job of giving you the feel for a life of a circus worker, and the story is enhanced by the black-and-white photos of actual circus performers from the era. You feel like you're looking at photos of the actual characters that populate the book. In the Author's Note and the accompanying interview, Ms. Gruen talks about her inspiration and research for the book. There are a million little details that give this book such an authentic feel. She really did her homework and it shows. From the words used by the characters to the descriptions of the logistics of the circus to the types of men and women who made their home in what was essentially a traveling, self-contained community, I felt like I was really there on the circus train.Although the heart of the book is what happens to Jacob when he joins the circus, the book alternates between the elderly Jacob in the nursing home and young Jacob in the circus. I thought this juxtasposition worked well (except for the very end--I personally didn't care for the final choice that Gruen made for the elderly Jacob). When the circus comes to town and triggers Jacob's memories, his story unfolds in a natural way--with the reader getting more and more drawn in to Jacob's story as it unfolds in the book and in his memories.In addition, Gruen establishes a framing device in the prologue that influences the reader from the very start of the novel. I found this particular choice extremely effective--and I loved how she pulled it off and tied it together at the end. I love when an author plays with her readers a little bit, and Gruen did a great job in this aspect.If you're looking for a movie to go with the book, I must recommend Dumbo. I kept picturing scenes from that movie as I read the book, and I could completely imagine this story being told in a similar way.My Final RecommendationI definitely see why this book was a bestseller. It offers something for everyone--a unique setting, a bit of history, a romantic triangle, animals, an examination in what it means to grow old. This book effortlessly fits all of this in without seeming forced or strained. And on top of that, it is just a good story that makes you want to find out what happens next. If you haven't read it already, I think it is definitely worth a read. If I was attending the Benzini Brothers circus, I would be standing up and yelling ""Encore!

The writing didn't get in the way of the story (which I love). I loved the animal characters and their relations with the humans. It had a ""Life of Pi"" vibe, but was more grounded in reality. I got very attached to the main character as an old man (it jumps back and forth - but not in an annoying way - really lends itself to telling the epic of his life while only delving into a few years of it). The author shows restraint describing any suffering of animals and lowly circus workers - which I appreciate - can't stand when they knock you over the head with it.

A1L8XHB6BPYBHH,0002007770,Jennybrooke,1,1,"Water for Elephants is a outstanding story told through Jacob Jankowski, a ninety year-old man who lives in a nursing home. The story unfolds as Jacob reflects his youth - growing up in the depression, working at a second rate traveling circus, and falling in love with a married woman. The most interesting aspect of this book is the insightful and diligent research on the subject matter and historical accuracy.While the book was an excellent read, I felt a few parts hard to read. Primarily it involved the inhumane and mistreatment of animals and circus staff. While the depression forced hardship on the entire population, the less important animals and staff of the circus suffered greatly from food and water deprivation as well as lack proper living quarters and medical care. Euthanization was common. As the author explores the innocence and personality of the animals and staff, the hand of the evil money-driven circus owner leaves his indelible mark.Overall, although several chapter left me upset, I believe the story is true to the times and is masterfully written.

Jacob befriends numerous characters, from the glamorous performer Marlena, to the alcoholic Camel, who works setting up the circus, to the Benzini Brothers' star elephant, Rosie. As he travels between different castes of the circus and across America, Jacob narrates the triumphs and hardships experienced by the people and animals of the Great Depression-era attraction.Interspersed throughout the novel are chapters that introduce the reader to the present-day, nonagenarian Jacob, as he laments his current living arrangement in a nursing home.Despite several graphic descriptions of animal abuse and the cruelty displayed the novel's antagonists, the story is ultimately fun, escapist and sentimental, with an optimistic, if improbable, conclusion.",4,"Fun, escapist novel",1217894400,"08 5, 2008"

AHFZGCPNCHI6A,0002007770,Jerald B,1,1,"Don't be fooled...or misled...by the title.  It is an important but oblique reference to an all too human interaction that will unfold as the plot develops.  And while it relates to an important character, it is primarily a tongue in cheek reference to our understanding of relationships with humans and the intelligent animals with whom we share this world.  This book was first recommended to me by a new friend almost 18 months ago, and while I admire elephants and have enjoyed circuses I have no special affinity for either.  So it went on my ""to read"" list.  Finally, a few days ago I downloaded it to my Kindle. Within the first few pages I understood why my now close friend had described this as one of the ""best books ever.""  Although I usually read multiple books at the same time...after all, don't most people who watch television watch different programs each day...with this book I read only one other concurrently.  Water for Elephants was just too compelling to be away from for any length of time.  Written in the first person this book will amuse, excite, and at times startle.  More importantly, the author has developed characters with real life and sometimes exasperating flaws.  Characters who, like people in the real world, don't always fully understand the consequences of their actions in real time and who may act spontaneously at other times in ways that each of us from our different life experiences may find surprising.  It is part of what makes this wonderfully powerful book both real and interesting.  And at the close you will want to read the interview with the author, a fascinatingly brief narrative of how this book came to life and was developed.

It was quick, painless, entertaining but I was not invested in the characters.  That is a crucial difference for me.  And while I received quite a good history lesson as regards circuses and other depression era details, I felt at the same time I was reading someones writing exercise or assignment.

A1KGKVUBSVXEN9,0002007770,"Jess ""Gone with the Words""",1,1,"(Review originally posted at GoneWithTheWords.com)The book begins with ninety year old Jacob remembering a very intense and disturbing event from his time with the circus that will leave you wanting to find out how it got to that point. The chapters then alternate between old Jacob and his very depressed state at the Assisted Living Facility and him remembering his journey with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. The circumstances on how he came to join the circus as the show Veterinarian were very sad. He went from being a young man about to graduate from Cornell, his whole future ahead of him and the possibility of FINALLY losing his virginity, to having no one and nowhere to go.Once on the show, he meets August, the show's equestrian director and superintendent of animals. August is one very questionable character. He can be the most charming man around and moments later he can turn into the most terrifying creature you've ever encountered. He also meets Marlena, August's wife, and falls in love with her on the spot. At a later point, the show aquires an elephant named Rosie who is thought to be stupid because she won't learn to do anything the trainers try to make her do. Rosie plays a huge part in this story, and she gave me the biggest surprise in this book. This story also takes you on an eye opening journey through the sad conditions circus employees and animals were under in 1931.Water for Elephants was a completely different read for me. It was Adult, and it was realistic, and I loved it. I was a little skeptical about the circus theme. Can't say I've ever been curious enough about its workings to read a book revolving around one, but I am so glad I did because it was sooo much more than that! It made me laugh, cry and gasp in astonishment sometimes. It was a huge plus knowing this will be a movie (coming out in April) starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon as the main characters.

I got to the end and thought, ""oh.. that's it?"" I particularly thought the development of the ""love story"" aspect was unsatisfying - just why is Jacob so obsessed with Marlena, other than his attraction towards her? You never really see their relationship blossom to the point where his love and devotion towards her are justified.

The animals are mistreated, the workers are mistreated, and the ""ring leader"" Uncle Al, is an egotistical, greedy SOB that you will love to hate. The things that Jacob witnesses are truly appalling.The research that Gruen did in preparation for this story was definitely the most interesting aspect of the book. However, then comes the middle of the book. I got very bored, and found it hard to finish chapter after chapter. Now having finished the book, I understand that Gruen was just setting up the end of the story. The middle was a  necessary ""evil"".Without giving anything away, the ending was interesting.

The circus has come to the nursing home residents, and this takes Jacob back in time in the book as he tells his story. The book goes back and forth between the past and present tense.When Jake's parents die unexpectedly in a tragic accident,he is 23-years old and lost now. The house was taken away since unbeknowst to Jake, his parents had been in debt, and the house is taken away, and all because his father couldn't let the animals go hungry. He and Jake were in a veterinary practice together, and now it's all gone. Jake, not knowing what to do, went back to school to finish his final exams. He walks out in the middle of it though, and goes toward the train tracks. He climbs aboard a circus train unknowingly, which is the Benzini Brothers, The Greatest Show on Earth. From then on, his life changes forever.Camel is the older man that takes Jake under his wing, and shows him the ropes more or less. He is given the job of cleaning up after the animals, and later acted as a vet. Jake is introduced to Walter, and at first Walter deeply resents Jake at first, and having to share his quarters with him. But when Jake saves his pet Queenie, the two strike a friendship.The boss, August is a hateful cruel man. When an elephant, Rosie is brought in to the mix, August is absolutely sadistic to that poor animal.

Jake falls in love with her almost immediately, and knows that Marlena is miserable with her mentally ill husband. She falls for Jake as well, and when it is discovered that they are sneaking away by August, a horrible disaster strikes, and Jake almost doesn't survive.The book comes to an earth-shattering climax and has quite the ending which is a surprise.",4,Life takes an unexpected turn to the circus....,1187395200,"08 18, 2007"

Both Jacob's young life as a student and a vet for a traveling circus and, as we first meet him, in his 90's in the nursing home are set before you in beautiful, & sometimes heartbreaking detail.Benzini Brother's circus is portrayed in all it's glory and in all it's horror. The Depression era, and circus life at the time, is richly described and well researched. It is a murder mystery whose ending is both surprising and yet somehow righteously predictable. Still,... it was FUN! You see the murder in the beginning, but not until the end when you have all of the story behind you, do you get to see the truth. I cheered, as did many in my book club! We all agreed that we had never LAUGHED when a murderer was revealed in a novel, until Water For Elephants!I suppose that the best way to describe this story is that it is a paradox.

Jacob Jankowski tells his story both in the form of memories while in a nursing home, and as the real time experiences of a 23-year old failed veterinary student in the midst of the Depression. Failing his exams, Jacob flees home and hooks up with a circus; he survives in this brutal world only because he has some skill with animals. Gruen paints a marvelous, completely believable portrait of a circus of the thirties, where the ruthless Uncle Al rules with the power of life and death. He deviates from planned appearances only to pick up the pieces of other failed circuses. Once someone ceases to be of use to the show, or if the money doesn't roll in as planned, they're gone--sometimes forever. It's a harsh world, but apparently historically accurate. And the old black and white photos at the beginning of each chapter are fascinating! Gruen's meticulous research makes the book--the plot line is a bit predictable and the ending a fantasy.

A20VXF9DYI0I6H,0002007770,J. Norburn,4,5,"Water for Elephants is an immensely entertaining, well researched novel.  It's easy to see why this book is so popular.  That said; there are a few short comings, some minor, some more substantial.The research about depression era circus' (not that I profess to be an expert) is excellent and makes a fascinating backdrop to the story.  While the author makes great use of her research, the tone of the novel, particularly the dialogue, is too contemporary to sound authentic.  While this is a fault to some extent, it isn't one that will bother most readers.  In fact, it makes the novel more readable,likely contributing to it's success.  Fans of Faulkner and Steinbeck, of course, may beg to differ.I'm not sure why the author chose to make the novel's principal villain Jewish and allegedly Paranoid Schizophrenic.  The fact that he is Jewish is irrelevant to the plot (aside from the fact that it apparently makes his wife's family more likely to disown her) and his behaviour, while deplorable at times, isn't consistent with Schizophrenia at all.  These may seem like minor points, but they bothered me a little because they play into stereo types and were completely unnecessary.The romance that develops between Jacob and Marlena is predictable and uninspired.  The murder during the stampede is a little too contrived and highly improbable, and the final chapter is a little too sentimental for my tastes.  But despite these grievances, I was won over.The first half of the novel is definitely stronger than the second half.  Gruen's writing style is accessible, entertaining, and often very funny.  Jacob as an old man is cantankerous and vulnerable, and his frustration with growing old is truly heartbreaking.  These `present day' chapters are arguably the strongest in the novel.  While the love story is admittedly unremarkable, it was fascinating to read about life in the circus.  Greun weaves a series of amusing and presumably real (at least according to circus lore) anacdotes into the story.All in all, it isn't hard to see why this novel is a bestseller.  True, the love story is a little flat, but overall, the novel is hard not to like.  Water for Elephants isn't a literary masterpiece, but it's enormously entertaining.

However, everything that others have said about the believability of some of the situations holds true (as in Jacob taking the knife away from Walter when he would need it most).  My main problem with the story was the constant going back and forth from the 90 something character to the young Jacob.  The author didn't make these transitions meaningful in any way.  There was no reason why at some point it switched back in time and then for no reason whatsoever it switched to real time.  And, although I understand people can become forgetful and cranky in their old age, there was no way that the old Jacob was similar to the personality of the young Jacob.  People may get older, but their basic personalities stay the same, and these two Jacobs were totally dissimilar.  And, the author spent too much time in letting us know the horrid aspects of old folks in an old folks home and left us with none of the joys of companionship and the other qualities that people can enjoy in assisted living.

Later the plot goes completely off the rails and out of the hands of the main character, as people are murdered and ""Jacob"" himself almost becomes a murderer. This book is mostly dark stuff involving death, sex, and money. At times its cheesy and conservative, unrealistic. Its quite an exciting book and a fast read, but there is a lot more that could have been done. The author is quite talented, and I hope her next book is a classic, but this time she written a somewhat formulaic, generally nasty story here that ends in a wreck.

Gruen grabs you from page one, plunks you down into the main character's universe (alternately a present-day nursing home and the depression-era circus).  You care. You ride up and down with him, and experience everything first hand.This is a great story blending historic facts (at least, facts in an anthropological kind of way - she did her research for sure) and great fiction. She uses the flashback as a vehicle perfectly, blending the main character's present-day circumstances with his past, lending a gravitas to his current feelings and actions that draws you in and holds you tight.I must admit, the very ending was a bit of a stretch on the imagination, but by that time I had tears in my eyes and was willing to suspend a bit more disbelief than I normally would.  I was sad to see this end.Kindle purchases be forewarned: each chapter has an historic photo from the circus; they show up OK on the screen, but the paper print might show this better.

A2ECPW4RA7NWMP,0002007770,John Sollami,5,6,"Tapping into a unique and compelling piece of Americana, Sara Gruen has created an entertaining novel under the big top of the traveling depression-era circus. Cutting in and out of the present, the novel's 90- (or 93-) year-old narrator, Jacob Jankowski, brings us into both his life in a nursing home and his incredible 3 and a half months many years ago as the ""vet"" of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Like Salieri in ""Amadeus,"" Jacob views his past as if happening in the moment, and we are treated to a host of nasty and pathetic as well as complex and individualized characters who live from stop to stop along the rail lines and entertain in towns small and large for the ""rubes.""Although this set-up is terrific, the love story around which the novel turns is thin and familiar, and the writing, somewhere around page 250, becomes repetitious and uninteresting. Even so, this quick read is well worth the time as an entertainment. I have no doubt, as well, that Hollywood will pick up on this work, as it lends itself completely to a 3-star movie.

Under duress and without finishing the exam, he walks out of the exam building and into a tumultuous life with the circus.At the age of 90, Jacob finds himself in an assisted care facility where he blows his top when a fellow senior, a lawyer, claims to have worked for the circus and delivered water for elephants.

A2OG6UCUZCZNV8,0002007770,jonathan briggs,1,2,"Jacob Jankowski's parents perfunctorily die in the opening of this mawkish melodrama, and Jacob drops out of vet school and runs away to join the circus, where he finds fast work as a veterinarian for a menagerie of anthropomorphic animals. Jacob also finds romance (not with the animals), adventure and a real Snidely Whiplash of a villain. Sara Gruen copies the manipulative, crowd-pleasing instincts of Stephen King and Ron Howard without displaying any of the personality seen in those men's work. She writes in a bland, transparent, easy-to-read prose of cliche, predictability and cheap sentiment. This is the kind of book you can read in a single afternoon without ever having to pause to think. It goes down like a bag of circus cotton candy, and it's about as nourishing. Strictly LCD entertainment. It's like ""Titanic"" at the circus! It's like ""Seabiscuit"" with an elephant! After reading one of the most ludicrous endings ever written in the history of populist claptrap, I think I'm being more than generous with my two stars. To the critics who overpraised ""Water for Elephants,"" I offer this quote from the novel: ""Surely you can't all be happy with this ... this ... pap?""",2,"More like ""Treacle for Housewives""",1336953600,"05 14, 2012"

I particularly liked the little catch-words that usually connected the ""assisted living"" chapters with the circus chapters. Gruen generally wrote in such connections, and I found them both ingeniously crafted and useful in uniting the narrative.In addition to telling a great story, Gruen gives a remarkably detailed picture of the circus world of the 1930s. I had definitely never heard of a ""cooch tent"" before reading this book, for example, and Gruen's depiction of its solo practitioner is thoughtful, humane, and free of cliches. The ideas of circuses getting booted out of town, of people getting booted off the circus trains, and of entrepreneurs cannibalizing the remnants of failed circuses were also quite fascinating.To the extent that Gruen wanted to make an analogy to the biblical Jacob story by obscurely dropped hints and anagrammed names, I think, however, that she pushed too far.

The classic elephant hunting books ""Using Aircraft for Elephant Hunting"" and ""Camouflage Blinds for Elephants"" are both classics and are superb additions to the literature. Neither of those books deals with the tricky task of elephant hunting from boats or Jet Skis, and I've been waiting for the book that would finally address that obvious shortcoming. But, and I guess this might be a spoiler alert, this book doesn't seem at ALL to be about hunting elephants from the water! I read it very carefully, and even re-read whole sections, thinking that the author was setting the context that would play a role in the hunt. But on the second to last page I realized with horror and, literally, said out loud ""I don't think she's actually gonna kill this elephant... in fact I don't think she is planning on killing ANY elephants!"" So if you are looking for a reference book on aquatic elephant hunting, or tactics on elephant removal from lakes and oceans, this is not the book for you.

Many of the extraordinary incidents in this novel, according to the author's notes, are rooted in oral history or based on anecdotes or actual written reports of those early 20th century years.  Those who rode the circus rails, many being family castaways and society's rejects, found family and home in that unique traveling milieu of humanity and managerie, and, in the process, grew tough in body and spirit.  BUT, even if you don't give a hoot about circuses or circus people, don't be put off by the title or theme.  (Although, is there really anyone in their 30s plus years who did not, as a child, sit and watch wide-eyed, delighting in the cheap glitz, the pulsating music, the flamboyant and rhinestone-studded costumes and, yes, the size and smell of the elephants, when the circus came to town?) This story is nostalgic in its telling, engaging in its characters, with a plot that clearly aligns the good guys against the bad.  There are wonderful descriptions of authentic circus activity, on-site intrigue, and a romance that you will really care about.  All of this, tucked into the ruminations of a contentious 90-year-old ""assisted-living"" resident whom you will also really care about.I suspect, however, one would have to have a soft spot for animals to want to open this novel and then to inhale it, as I did, in just a day and a half.

Loosely translated, it means a that there is a certain uselessness to give someone who is VERY poor anything - for the very reason that it will never be enough. The elephants in the wild travel in herds and are usually the first to suck a water hole dry.  The metaphor is complete implying the uselessness of bringing a thirsty elephant a bucket of water, or several, to quench its thirst.As soon as I saw the big top cover I was even more interested. I read once that when circus elephants arrived in a town, many kids would gather and offer to bring water to the elephant so it could drink and they may be rewarded with free tickets.  Maybe this was it?? The figure of a man entering a Big top from the side flap, only to see a figure looking in from the main door struck me as if it were something I was not supposed to see. This was the beginning of a mezmerizing journey....In post-depression America, Jacob Jankowski, a bound-for-glory, then displaced graduate student who tragically loses his parents, home and future in the first breath of the story, is our 23 year old hero that we instantly like and feel sorry for.  He impulsively, almost accidentally, joins a circus, instantly realizing how destitute he is.  Hard work, hideous living conditions, a life on the rails, BUT food...becomes his reality.  In the world that he (and we) is new to, he is forced to see and witness more than meets the normal spectator's eye.  In no time we all face the reality of running a circus instead of watching one.The screeching of brakes against rails; railcars stuffed with wild and exotic animals as well as straw, manure, closely knit sleeping quarters; townfolk (or Rubes) that come to the show; sensuality, sex, alcoholism; and Uncle Al, the Ringleader/owner/cheat/boss extrordinairre, are just for suckers! These are only the backdrop of a magnificent story. Interwoven is the love, the man, the compassion of caretakers.  Jacob.  Marlena.  August.I have to admit that I was surprised and pleased at the ending that the author gives many clues leading up to, but I never got.  It is, as a matter of fact, what made me really love the book.  The title is the bullhook of what will later prove to be useless information.  The payoff at the end is worth it... and makes you want to research the whole history yourself.A dramatic story with incredible insight and scene recreation, at times I would come to the end of a chapter, look around and remember that I was here, not there.",5,Transplanted into Another World,1272499200,"04 29, 2010"
AVH24GQ87MNC9,0002007770,J. Rose,0,2,"I was excited to read this book, but I was disappointed in it. Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a ""90 or 93 year old man"" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works. It is clear she did a lot of research on how the circuses worked, and it was nice to be able to picture those details.The book had so much potential.

A16JKCJYYMFA61,0002007770,J. Schell,5,11,"So, this is the dreck that is passing for 'modern literature' these days? Honestly, after hearing some very good reviews about this books (actually, the reviews came to me via a co-worker who pressed a hand to her stomach, frowned and said, ""my daughter and I loved this book"") I figured I would give it a try.The first sign that this was not going to wind up on my favorite book list was that after an hour or so of reading, I realized that I was more than 100 pages in. Normally when I'm reading, I pause occasionally to think, reflect, sympathize, emphasize, synthesize, etc, etc, etc. But alas, nothing deep and worthy of reflection was to be found. Nothing to stop me reading for a moment to think about what I'd just read. Not that I was expecting much, but I find myself more appreciative of a book, story, news article, movie or television show if it can make me think about at least something more than the words in front of my face. Again, not here. There was nothing to be found.Eventually, as the story continued and I learned more about Jacob and the circus, I can't say I was surprised when I found myself not caring one way or the other what was going to happen to him, or the rest of the circus bunch - there was nothing for me to connect myself to these characters with. If anything, the more I read, the more impressed I became with the author's ability to keep me so detached!In addition to the weak and utterly predictable story, (I mean, who didn't see that August was either bi-polar or a schizophrenic, that Marlena was going to get pregnant, or that Jacob's family wasn't going to show?), the dialogue comes out incredibly thin - to the point that I'm actually thinking that the author has never heard two people speak to one another. The dialogue comes across as forced and, for lack of a better term, soap opera-ish. I half expected to hear the dramatic soap opera bumper at the end of each chapter ""will Jacob get the girl, will August find out about their illicit love affair and will Rosie finally learn English? Tune in next chapter..""But I digress. For everything I've stacked in the negative column about this book, there is one redeeming quality - and that is the story. I'm (somewhat) not ashamed to admit that I literally couldn't put this book down. It was like literary candy on a rainy day (actually a smoky day here in So-Cal). I picked up the book at 8am and set it down again around 10pm (having stopped for food, news updates, etc). Needless to say, I was disappointed.Overall, a good book for when you require some mindless entertainment - like sitting in an airport, or on death row.Finally, I was not impressed with the authors use of 'authentic circus lingo.' Apparently, she did some research. Well, I should hope so!",2,"1 star for the story, 1 star for the elephant...",1193184000,"10 24, 2007"

It really doesn't take long to figure out where the story is going.  You can see it coming a mile away.  Second, Ms Gruen is writing the story from a male perspective, but she needs a little more practice.  Jacob seemed like a mama's boy, but I don't think that was her intention, instead it was her inability to really connect to her male character.Despite these minor flaws I found the story engrossing and from my male perspective I didn't think it ever got into 'romance novel' territory.  So guys, it's safe to read.  The trains, boozin' and rough living of a traveling circus in 1931 was very interesting.  The way Gruen shifts the novel from the past to Jacob's current state of living in a nursing home is jarring and makes you feel just like Jacob when he is 90, or 93, you want to get back to the circus.",4,Enjoyable Read,1215820800,"07 12, 2008"

After the teaser of a prologue, during which a murder takes place, the story shifts to real-time in the life of ninety or ninety-three year old nursing home resident Jacob Jakowski, as he realizes that a circus has rolled up mere blocks away. He is resigned to suffering through several standard days of monotony - wakefulness alternating with bouts of night-time and inadvertent, memory-filled dozing as he anticipates viewing the upcoming circus performance. Although his brain founders, his wit and wisdom-filled thoughts and words are spot on: of memory ""You start to forget words: they're on the tip of your tongue, but instead of eventually dislodging, they stay there,"" forced to take an antidepressant, ""You want to drug me. You want to turn me into a Jell-O eating sheep,"" on nursing home life, ""I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person,"" and after explaining his inability to keep track of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, ""My brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges."" The story of his circus-related escapades is equally good. Although the ending seems more contrived than likely and the plot contains a fair amount of sexual situations, violence and animal cruelty, its uniqueness as well as several fact-based plot parts overshadow its few faults.

But let me tell you that it certainly did.I was a little apprehensive about how it started, with Jacob in his golden years reflecting on his youth, but in the end I found this was actually one of the things I enjoyed about how the book was written.  Like Jacob, I longed for the times when his mind slipped back to his younger years when his body was whole and his mind sharp, when his passions ran high and his life was full of adventure.  I could relate to his frustration with his age, mental status and physically limitations.The story of his life was emotional, and felt very real.  The ending was surprisingly satisfying for the reader and Jacob, possibly because Jacob received what we all hope for at the end of a long life.

This is no Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth.  This is a downtrodden, edging ever closer to disaster circus run by the same type of people.

Not much happens in the present day chapters and for a while I wondered what they were adding to the book, but the pay off at the end is very satisfying.  While I don't know a lot about circuses in the depression era, my impression was that the book is well researched and certainly it brings that world very vividly to life.

The pace is almost like the circus train itself: it starts chugging forward slowly and then before you know it, you're flying so fast you can barely keep your balance! Gruen's writing is so evocative -- you feel like you are on that train and in those tents. You taste the food, smell the smells, hear the sounds, feel the animals and the movement of the train. It's amazing that she could write so vividly about an era in history with which she had no prior knowledge before writing the book.The only thing I didn't like about it were the scenes involving animal cruelty.

This book was different, it had my rapt attention from start to finish - though the end was disappointing to me. After chapters of such a great story, I found the almost ridiculous improbability of the ending to be quite out of place. I also could have happily lived without the animal abuse and the unnecessary deaths of Walter & Camel, but the ending sat particularly poorly with me.

The characters are unforgettable and this includes the animals. Yes it was painfully sad and I was angered when the abuse was occurring but still I read on. I must say this book made a big impression upon me as far as a story of adventure, travel, history and love all rolled into one. When I had my first book read for my debut novel on Friday, June 13th, 2008 the store manager (who took a chance on an unknown self-published author) predicted that my book, like ""Water for Elephants"", would have the same impact in time. She had said that Sar Gruen at first couldn't get the attention her book deserved but on went life to where WFE ended up being one of the most interesting accounts of US circus story ever told.

But as endearing as the concept was, I couldn't get past the fact that I honestly didn't care that much about any of the characters.  Sorry but it had to be said.  The characters were flat, the story was more fantasy than fiction and worst of all, the whole thing felt quite familiar.  It was only later that it occured to me that this story was trying very hard to be Fried Green Tomatoes and/or Driving Miss Daisy; the difference is that I actually cared about the characters in those stories.

The book had the added downfall of an elephant as a main character and while I love animals, I generally don't like to read about them. I thought this book had nothing to offer me . . . and I was very wrong.Reliving his young years right along with 90 year old Jacob Jankowski was a beautiful journey. I normally don't care for the sentimentality inherent in an old narrator looking back on his young days, but I found Water for Elephants didn't use cheap tricks to manipulate the reader's feelings. Instead it had a slow build and satisfying finish - marks of a novel well written. As the old man (Jacob) tells his story, I began to feel all the emotions that he did. By the end, I was fully invested.Gruen brings to life - the Depression era geeks and freaks of the circus with generous but not overdone descriptions.  I became so engrossed in that world that it was jarring to come back to reality when I closed the book.

He details his unique experiences in the traveling show and of all the colorful people he became friends and enemies with.

ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,0002007770,kaduzy,216,258,"I found this book interesting because of the research Ms. Gruen obviously did on train circuses and depression-era life.  I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book.  Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here.  The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider.  We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains.  Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and ""Uncle Al"", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page.  For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish.  I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater.  He's simply too many things rolled into one.  Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable.  And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic.  Perhaps if she'd actually used the ""show, don't tell"" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional.  As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man.  One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do.  Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook.  It's hard to respect a character like that.  Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram.  In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action.  I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where  a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story.  Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book three stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man.  I also really got a kick out of the ending.  But on the whole, I would recommend this as a library book or a used book store book -- definitely NOT one you pay full price for.",3,Well researched but lacking,1187049600,"08 14, 2007"

A2CFSAYVC70IKS,0002007770,kallen,8,12,"This book intrigued me because it is not something I'd normally be interested in reading. I was expecting to be ""moved""--as so many reviewers had indicated. Instead, I was only ""moved"" to flip the pages as quickly as possible to at least come to the surprise ending that was indicated in some reviews.The premise, the whole idea of a story set in a circus backdrop during the Depression, was fantastic. The story itself, in my opinion, failed. It failed for several reasons. The characters appeared to be no more than pawns for moving the story forward--they never made it beyond the cardboard cliche stage. Even Jacob, whose latter years were more endearing to read, was always seen from afar. We never really got in his head at all. He was totally unbelievable. Kid drops out of vet school and joins the circus and acts like a thirteen year old with thirteen year old dialogue.Which brings me to the dialogue in this book. Horrible! I caught myself laughing out loud, in disbelief at the cheezy sentences. And at one point I thought if I read ""uh"" or ""um"" one more time I was going to scream and toss the book in the trash.All that aside, if it was meant to be just a gaudy quick genre-type read, then it wasn't marketed that way. No one ever rose above the surface level, and I simply didn't buy it--the narrator, the girl, the speech during that era.The ending, well, it was okay. It meshed with the rest of the book.And Jacob, he seemed terribly stupid and sophomoric to be a lifetime vet who'd attended Cornell, etc. He was also grouchy and not likable, except when he finally got real about himself growing old. In fact, I came across this passage in ch. 16, ""...my brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges..."" I thought YES!! This is what the story is really about: a man who once had keen senses and awareness, and traveled with a circus of all things, has come to the end of the ""show"" and he is facing it and fearing it simultaneously.

I certainly was not expecting to find such a gem in this light summer reading expedition.Gruen's gritty narrative, told as a series of flashbacks, provides a fictionalized glimpse at circus life in 1930s. Penniless and having just walked out on his exams, Jacob Jankowski finds himself hopping onto a train, like so many other drifters, hoping that it will lead him somewhere better than where he left. Instead he is thrust into a world very different than the Ivy-league shelter as he is employed as the resident veterinarian for the menagerie of a circus. The Benzini Brothers Most Amazing Show, like many other circuses of that time period, was not just home to performers and exotic animals, but to numerous taboos, like prostitution, bootlegging, and shady business practices.The characters were engaging and well-created and Gruen's descriptions of their actions and emotions as told through the eyes of Jacob carefully navigated you through a gauntlet of emotions, from frustration and anger, to bitter embarrassment. I still feel a bit of a blush when thinking about the aftermath of Jacob's horrifyingly uncomfortable encounter with booze, women, and a clown's revenge.The unique setting of circus life during the Great Depression provides the perfect touch of history, realism, and surrealism to this tale of a young man's search to find himself in an increasingly mad world. It was a gritty, desperate time in America's history and the shady backdrop of a migratory circus fits well. The descriptions are clear and vibrant and instead of leaving you with the feeling you just sat through a history lesson, you are transported.

ACO7DCVN9TRK4,0002007770,KapticaReviews,0,0,"""Water for Elephants"", by Sara Gruen is a compelling read that is fast-paced and difficult to put down. At times the plot ran so quickly I found myself trying to search for a way to slow down the course of the story, but to no avail. The quick pace, however, does seem to fit and reaches a broader audience that seems to want rapid conclusion and catharsis. Reversions to the present time are a nice break from circus life and I believe are Gruen's most vivid and compelling depictions of the novel. Her illustration of life at the nursing home and perspective of the `patients' which Jacob catches a nurse stating when the correct political term is `residents' provides an accurate and refreshing look at assisted elderly homes. The circus lifestyle is portrayed truthfully, but is often overshadowed by the dynamics and major plot-line concerned with the Romantic relationship and triangle of Jacob, August, and Marlena.Gruen's, ""Water for Elephants"", is an easy read with relatively simple themes and motifs to comprehend including: animal cruelty, abusive relationships, circus life in the 30's, life during the Great Depression, coming of age, and older age/aging. It truly encapsulates a broad range of topics, but the overlaying plot and issues are prevalent and riveting, if a bit rushed.",4,Circus Life Revistited in Gruen's Popular Title,1323648000,"12 12, 2011"

A2T9EHCUD7CNEB,0002007770,"Karie Hoskins ""karieh""",1,1,"For the past few months, I seem to have only been reading thought provoking books.  Some were illuminating, some were disturbing, some made me think about some of my most deeply held beliefs.  All in all - I am very glad I read these books, but as I started into ""Water for Elephants"", I realized that it had been quite a while since I read a book mainly to find out what happens at the end.My dad recommended this book - and I'm glad he did.  It's a wonderful story.  We experience, along with the main character Jacob, two parts of his life.  We travel through the Great Depression with him after he runs away and joins the circus (!) and we also see his current life as a patient/resident of an assisted living center.  Both times of his life were interesting to me.  I know next to nothing about circuses - yet I could almost smell the sawdust and hear the music as I made my way through this tale.Gruen has filled her story with the colorful characters one would expect from a circus troupe.  Beautiful acrobats, tortured clowns, animals with personalities almost as big as their trainers (and sometimes bigger!).  The details are excellently woven in, letting the reader see just enough without blocking one's imagination.  As the story builds towards the climax - I found myself doubting the ending I had been sure would take place.  Gruen creates just enough tension and suspense to keep the reader turning the pages at a brisk pace.I enjoyed, too, the scenes of Jacob in the present day.  All circus aspects aside, the book has some excellent insight into a man who feels as if he has outlived his life...without becoming a man who was finished with living.  His fears of losing his memories and mind, the despair he feels at the sameness of each day, and the appreciation he has for the few delights left in his day to day existence are beautifully crafted.  He may come across as a crotchety old man at times, but the reader, and a few characters whose eyes still see a man instead of an old man, know that not to be true.""Water for Elephants"" was a very enjoyable story.  It was an interesting and fun book - well researched and well-written.

I always like to warn people just in case, but in this situation I really don't think it's necessary, becuase the very first chapter sort of ruins the polt anyways.  In the very first chapter we are given a flash back to all the actual drama of the book and we are told that in the middle of a stampede in the menagerie of a circus... rosie the elephant kills her trainer August.  This did grab my attention and get me into the book.  But as I went along, I realized,  I think they gave away all the good stuff in the first couple pages!  I would much rather have not known that this incident was going to happen so early on!  Because really, this is the major turning point of the book.  THE event the whole story is leading up to.  So, really, there are no real surprises here.However, with that being said, I must admit that the story is very beautifully written and does a great job of creating to amazing beautiful mental pictures as you go.  It will make a very visually appealing movie.  And I liked the scenes in the nursing home where we really get to know Jacob the main charater.  And I loved the bond created bewteen all the circus people and the animals throughout the story.  I just felt that since they told the ending right away, they took all the mystery and suspense out of the book.  :(And on a final note... the very very ending, was cute in some ways, but it was incredibly unbelieveable, and kinda silly.

I offered lots of excuses as I put it off, but the truth is, I couldn't care less about the circus. When I finally gave in and started reading Water for Elephants, I realized on the first page that my apathy for the circus didn't matter.This was a touching, clever, totally unexpected story. It offers a window into how we treat the elderly, animals, and people of a different class, without ever being preachy.

(I hope I'll be forgiven a brief sidebar here.) Two elephants named Max and Patty, for example, tricked their zookeeper/trainer at night when they were supposed to go inside. The trainer always left two treats inside so that both elephants would go in and he could shut the door. One evening at ""bedtime,"" Max went inside but Patty didn't. Then Max came out with his treat, and Patty went in and came back out with hers. So now the're both out and they each have a treat.  How did they make this plan and communicate it to each other? And notice that Max didn't take both treats! He left Patty hers. They are loyal, and they know how to share.Some readers/reviewers have different things they would have liked more or less of, depending largely on whether they prefer plot-driven or character-driven stories. I think that Sara Gruen has done a masterful job of creating a novel that is both: tell a fascinating and historically accurate story with distinct, memorable characters who are vividly portrayed. If I had to choose something I'd have liked more of--without giving the story away (These are not supposed to be summaries/synopses, are they?)--I'd say a more-detailed treatment of what happened (Rosie included) between the story's climax (just after, especially) and the touchingly satisfying ending.

One women in my book club felt it was a tad graphic and even though I agree to a point I felt it was necessary for us to see Jacob experience a world of unspoken truths.  The life on a circus train exposes him to situations that he definitely wouldn't have seen as a neighborhood vet, including, sex, alcoholism, prostitution, starvation, survival... This is written from Jacob's perspective, a boy who's been snatched from a life of predictable comforts and is thrown into a nomadic life aboard a, virtually life-threatening, train to nowhere; of course it's going to be a bit graphic and detail emphasized!This book really transports you into an era long past and I could feel and smell the circus.

I almost gave up trying to sort out who all these people were and believe it or not, a lot of them weren't mentioned more than a few times. Still, it was jarring trying to figure out who was important and who wasn't.2. As soon as Jacob sees Marlena, the beautiful equestrian performer, we know that they are going to be romantically involved. But when their romance does take off, there's no real build up. I didn't find myself caring about their romance because it wasn't something they fought for: they just happened to fall into bed together one day. Woohoo.3.

I purchased it solely based on its popularity.I started reading it and had a bit of a hard time moving forward. English is not my native tongue and all the circus talk really made my head spin. I took a short break and finished an easy read and then resumed this book. I am glad I did.I felt very engaged after 1/3 of the book when most of the characters started to build and show their individual qualities. As the book went on, I felt I was also living in this circus train and witnessing all the activities.My heart definitely melted when they acquired Rosie, the elephant and at the same time, I started loathing the character August for abusing the elephant so much. In addition to that, the performer Walter/Kinko also transformed into this loving person that looked out after others.About half way through the book, I think almost all readers wanted nothing more than Jacob and Marlena being together and the death of August and Uncle Al. One thing I do believe a good author offers is the connection between the readers and the characters and I definitely felt that engagement with some of them and my heart ached at times as the story continued.I am not sure if I am a big fan of the Old Jacob. Not that it is bad but I really just did not quite get why it was important to keep his voice in. I did not see how old Jacob has contributed to the book and I think it could do without.Overall, I enjoyed the book so much and I was very happy to have resumed and finished it.

As he feels he's losing control of his life, his mind slips back to the past, and through these lapses we're told the story.I never knew anything about how circuses traveled about in the past, and hearing about the cutthroat America during the Great Depression certainly brought an overpowering feel of reality to the story. Jobs were few and far between, and those that had them did anything they could to keep them. Describing the desperate times, the hobo jungles, and the pay cuts served to present a great representation of the time period.I loved hearing about the different circus acts, though I know that was but a miniscule part of the story. The tiny facts and funniest little things kept my interest and had me smiling. This book is definitely dark and depressing at moments. At others, it is brilliantly bright and full of hope. Any novel that can pull off both sides of the spectrum nearly flawlessly is excellent in my book.I give Water for Elephants 5/5 stars. It was fantastic, and I'll definitely have to check out the upcoming movie now! I really recommend it. I have a feeling it is one of those books I will never forget.",5,Much more than I expected!,1370736000,"06 9, 2013"

The author let's you clearly see a very frail old man, his present hospital-like surroundings including the nursing staff and other elderly people in this assisted living facility.The author is clever enough to break up the terrible animal and human cruelties and sadness of the early 1930's era, the circus itself and the indignities some humans endured by inserting enough humor and back flashes to keep the reader from getting very depressed.This is not a pretty story, but it certainly reminds me of the era, which I am old enough to remember, not from a circus life, but from the life of a very poor, homeless family.The author took me back to places I have not been in several decades. I can smell the circus animals, see the uppity ""performers"" as well as the horrible ""tents"", the freaks and the laborers who set up and take down the tents.  I can visualise from the words of Sara Gruen, the trains in which many circus people travelled. Oh, yes, believe it or not as a little child, but old enough to remember, this is a mode of travel I recall vividly.I have put Sara Gruen's other books on my Amazon wish list and if I don't receive them as gifts I will eventually buy them for myself.

Wow.Every time I hesitate to think I'll find a book that is captivating, entertaining, and that will keep my interest and keep me thinking about its characters long after the book is over, I somehow seem to find myself happily surprised. Water for Elephants was one of those books. It was really that good.I heard good things about it, always saw it on the shelves at bookstores, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to give it a chance. Why? A book about a circus in the depression/prohibition era is probably as far away from my ""normal"" reading zone as I can get.  But I'm telling you - it doesn't matter! Not one bit.Entertaining and engrossing from the very first chapter, I was taken away on this journey with the characters. Nothing short of fascinating, in ways I wouldn't have thought possible.  Part love story, part coming of age, this is at its roots, a story about life and the unexpected paths it may take. I really came to love the character of Jacob, and sympathize with his situation and his love for animals. It's been over a week since I've finished the novel, and I still think about the characters every day.  I really got caught up in their world which is something, I must say, is sometimes way too rare in the books I read. Many are good stories, but with Water for Elephants, I really felt like I was traveling along with them in their adventures. A pleasant surprise.Overall, I have already recommended to more than a few friends, and would encouragingly recommend it here.

Eckert ""Devourer of all books fantasy""",1,2,"I had this book on my to read list for some time, when I saw that the movie was coming out soon I decided I better get to reading this.  I listened to this as an audio book and it was very well done; they have two readers one for Jacob in his twenties and one for Jacob in his nineties.  It was a good read and I enjoyed learning about the circus.Jacob is ninety three and living in a retirement home, through his dreams and daydreams he relives a tumultuous time in his life in his twenties.  When Jacob is in his twenties he is getting ready to sit for his Veterinarian finals at Cornell University when he gets a call; his parents have been killed in a car accident.  Then when he gets home he finds out that the bank has seized his parents' house.  In a fit of grief and sorrow he abandons his exams and hops a train that just happens to be part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  Through a series of circumstances he ends up working for them as their vet; taking care of the exotic animals in their menagerie.  In the process of all of this he falls in love with a beautiful performer named Marlena who has a brutally viscous husband, who also happens to be Jacob's boss.There were a number of things I liked about this book.  The story moves quickly and has a sense of mystery and doom about it as Jacob falls deeper into the seedy goings on in the circus and deeper in love with Marlena.  It is very engaging.It is clever how you see into Jacob's life in the present while he is in a nursing home.  These portions of the story really tug at your heart and give insight into an old man struggling to retain his sense of self in an environment where everything is sanitized and ordered.  These glimpses are bittersweet in contrast to the crazy life Jacob lived; obviously this man has lived and lived well and it is heartbreaking to watch him struggle with the descent into age that we are all faced with.The majority of the story is about Jacob's life in the circus.  Gruen doesn't shy away from the nitty gritty including sex, violence, language; as such this is definitely an adult read.  Issues such as animal cruelty, squalid living conditions for workers, and the Depression are woven throughout.  Making the story very believable and easy to relate to.All of the characters in this book are very human and engaging and have a lot of depth. Even the villainous characters (Al and August) have moments of graciousness and goodness.  While the main ""good"" characters do things that border on bad, if only through neglect.The only thing that really bothered me with this book is that I thought Jacob made too many bad decisions and too many mistakes.  I understood that he was young and hot-headed, but at the same time he is supposed to be very smart...and well...let's just say he doesn't spend much time thinking about his actions.  A lot of what happened he brought on himself and I think that this was inconsistent with the way he was presented as an upstanding citizen and character.The book ends well and should leave readers happy and smiling.  The story is expertly told and the look into the way a circus runs fascinating.  It would have been nice to have an afterward of Gruen talking about how accurately she represented the circus in this book.  Were all circuses like this?  Or was this one particularly bad?Overall this was a very engaging story, I enjoyed it a lot, and am happy that I read it.  The characters are fascinating, the glimpses into both life in the circus and life in a nursing home intriguing as well.  I loved how the book was set up with us seeing the elder Jacob's memories/story through his eyes.

It suffers from a predictable plot, cardboard characters and formaldehyde dialogue, and its success is obviously due to the imprimatur of the Oracle Oprah (and you will notice that nearly all the positive reviews here are from the distaff side), but it does have one salient virtue. It gets all the facts right.I become enraged, when reading a novel, if I notice that the author was too lazy to research (look up) what he's writing about. In detective stories such errors are usually about guns; in other novels inaccuracies are often about cars or planes. But Ms. Gruen, to her everlasting credit, has all the arcane details of the bygone circus life perfectly accurate. Because of this, I'm eager to forgive the book's other shortcomings.Now, obviously Sara Gruen did not work in a circus in the 1930s. She has never worked in a circus. She obviously learned all the arcane details of circus lore from reading other, better books.

Make sure you have your Kleenex handy because Water for Elephants is a tear-jerker.The story is told in the first person with Jacob as the narrator.  The story switches from Jacob in his nineties in the nursing home to Jacob in his twenties during his circus days.  Sometimes alternating perspectives can get choppy but Sara Gruen gets the pacing just right.Water for Elephants is about a traveling circus, but it is mostly a love story---or at least it was for me.

I am especially taken with the depiction of life in a nursing home with the body of a 93-year-old and the wit and mind of a much much younger man. It gave me a whole new perspective on how sad and depressing life must be like in an institution like that and will make me spend more time getting to know those who find their homes in such a place.

It was certainly readable enough, but the love story between Jacob and Marlena was what kept the story going and for me, it just wasn't enough. I needed more feeling, more passion, more drama, and (if this was the angle the book was going to take) more sexy bits.Having recently readThe Night Circus, I like the angle of the dark side of the lives of traveling circus people, but it almost seemed like too much of a trope when Jacob ran away with the circus. Still, I suppose enough people must have done so back in the day for it to become a saying.I thought the book was good, but I was expecting something great given the book's popularity and I just don't feel like I found it with Water for Elephants.

A16EF94KHNPCZ7,0002007770,KennethHarmon,5,9,"I had the opportunity to meet Sara Gruen recently. She came to Fort Collins because her German Shephard needed open heart surgery, and while she was in town, she held a discussion/book signing at a local bookstore. Something she said struck me as rather odd. She said that she wanted the old circus photographs included in her novel because she didn't feel her readers would believe what she had written without the pictures. I'm not sure why she would feel this way, because as many reviewers have noted, her descriptions of the circus where the strongest parts of this novel.This was a book that I wanted to like better, but after all was said and done, it didn't leave much of an impression, other than her extensive research. The story, particularly the love story, was cliched, and the entire plot is predictable. Additionally, some parts of the story don't seem plausible. *SPOILER* For example, why would Jacob walk away from an Ivy League degree, needing only to complete a final exam? Yes, his parents were killed, but he knows that they made great sacrifices for him to attend Cornell. And what are the odds that when he jumps onto a passing train in the middle of the night, it just happens to be a circus train?In addition to the predictable plot, it was hard to relate to any of thecliched characters. I think it says a lot when the most interesting character in the book is Rosie the elephant. Jacob displays little or no character growth. And the book has a typical ""Hollywood"" ending where the good guys get everything they want, even though they've had to sacrifice virtually nothing. And some of the dialogue in this book reads like a romance novel.That said, there are flashes of quality in this novel. The sections that take place inside the nursing home are well done, and in fact, old Jacob is a more interesting character than young Jacob.I just wish that the author had taken as much care in plotting her book and developing her characters as she did in doing her research.",2,Mixed Emotions on this one.,1240617600,"04 25, 2009"

A1M49QNOFQWDBS,0002007770,"Kenny of LA ""Kenny""",1,1,"Water for Elephants is a very fine book, well worth the read, for many reasons:1.  The book wonderfully captures place and time.  Set in the depression, it authentically  captures the spirit and feel of the era, including its description of the economics of the time, hobo life, the depression, etc.2.  It vibrantly and realistically describes life in the travelling circuses of the era, including the freaks and other performers, the pecking order between management, performers and workers, life on the train, stops for shows in the small communities, and vivid descriptions of the performances.3.  The characters have depth and breadth, and touch you with their humanity (which is sometimes kind and more often than not, evil--as humans can be).4.  The novel very effectively contrasts the protagonist's current situation in a nursing home with his recollections of the bulk of the novel's depression-era actions.5.  Without giving too much away, the novel very satisfyingly (if perhaps a bit unrealistically) concludes with a feel good ending--and who can resist a happy ending.In conclusion, this book is a decently written, plot driven, page turner, which tells a touching tale, set against a colorful background of time and place, populated by characters which are larger than life (yet realistic in thought and deed).

I could never understand how he was finding comfort from his parents' death by being treated like crap and working like a dog with barely any water to drink or shower.I enjoyed the elderly Jacob much more, and was charmed by the ending.

(I would liken this skill to that of a masterful actor capable of playing a wide range of movie roles.)In ""Water For Elephants"" Sara Gruen showcases this rare talent, telling a Depression-era circus tale from the perspective of a veterinarian named Jacob Jankowski (both in his twenties and flashing back from his nineties) in a convincing and captivating manner.  The contrast between the innocent young Jacob's foray into the rough-and-tumble world of a traveling circus and the old Jacob's cynical ruminations on life in a nursing home creates a ""book end"" effect that makes his story feel more real and meaningful.Gruen has also infused her novel with enough historical details to bring the sights, sounds and smells of the midway, menagerie and big top to life, without cramming in superfluous details that could have dragged on the story line.  The dialogue is sublime, especially the banter between the working men who handle the behind-the-scenes grunt work.  Her characterization is strong as well: I was moved by the star-crossed romance between Jacob and Marlena, repulsed by the evil of August and Uncle Al, and captivated by the antics of Rosie the elephant.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience, most deserving of its long run on the best-seller list.",5,Run Away With the Circus,1188259200,"08 28, 2007"

This happens on p10, a revealing flashback on p50, this happens on p75 and this happens on p200, then a couple of twists to keep the end interesting and a stuck-on hollywood ending.

I thought the relationships with the animals were especially wonderful. Sara Gruen seemed to bluntly portray the sadness life has to offer, yet quietly affirm the fleeting joys which make it entirely worthwhile. I also enjoyed the thoughtful narrative concerning being elderly, as this isn't something I had put much thought into previously. After I finished the book I spent some time researching real life circus tidbits and stories, and it's interesting how the author wove the true stories into her story.",5,"Touching, yet honest.",1295568000,"01 21, 2011"

It may have been realistic, but served no purpose to be repeated over and over.  Also some scenes were too sexually explicit.  Its redeeming quality was the ending of the story.  I had to force myself to keep reading.  In the end I was glad I did because of the satisfactory (and somewhat surprising)ending.

A3E11WHSG52T0M,0002007770,KimberlyinMN,2,5,"I purchased this as an audiobook.  My husband and I listened to it on our trip down to and back from Iowa over Christmas. This was his first audiobook ever.  (Actually, his first book for pleasure since he was in high school.) This was a fantastic story! We found ourselves discussing the characters and storyline as if they were real when we would stop for lunch, etc.  I typically sleep for most of the drive (thankfully I am the passenger) but this book kept me awake the entire drive.The storyline starts out with main character as an old man. Then switches to him as a young man and how he ends up working with a circus that travels by train from location to location.  The characters are introduced beautifully. Each character has a distinct voice in the audiobook. Even though the story moves from present time and back to the past throughout the story, there is no confusion as to what ""time"" the story is in.  We are still talking about this book every so often.Kimberly",5,This book was even BETTER than I thought it would be!,1170201600,"01 31, 2007"
